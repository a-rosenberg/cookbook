### ingredients
- 1 cup cooked rice
- 2 cups broth (or water, or half/half)

- dash of sesame oil
- sesame seeds
- 1 green onion; greens thinly sliced
- (optional) roasted squash
- (optional) white pepper
- (optional) chili crunch oil
- (optional) pickled radish

### instructions
Blend cooked rice and broth until smooth with some chunks of suspended rice. 15-30 seconds on high. Pour into a saucepan and cook for 5 minutes to allow the rice to absorb some broth and thicken. 

Serve with green onions and shoyu plus other optional toppings.
