### ingredients
- 3 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 carrots; small dice
- 1-2 celery stalks; small dice
- 1 onion; small dice
- 1 cup beluga (black) lentils
- 4 (or 2.5 - 3 if using pressure cooker) cups vegetable broth
- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
- pasta, dried or homemade; cooked

### instructions
Can be cooked on the stovetop or in a pressure cooker. These instructions will go through both options then return to the steps that apply to both. 

#### *stovetop*
Heat the oil over medium-low heat then add carrots.  Cook for a couple of minutes then add onions and celery and cook until golden; about 10-15 minutes.

Rinse lentils then add to the pot.  Toss around then add the 4 cups of broth.  Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to a simmer and allow to cook for 35-45 minutes until the lentils have absorbed much of the water and are abundantly tender.  This is a good time to check the seasoning.

#### *pressure cooker*
Cook veggies in base of the pressure cooker on "saut√©" mode with the top off using 1-2 Tbsp olive oil.  Stir often so the vegetables don't burn, until browned and soft - about 5-10 minutes.  Add lentils and 2.5 - 3 cups of the hot broth to the pressure cooker.  Cover and set to 15 minutes on high pressure. Manually release pressure with a rag over the steam output.

#### *both*
Remove a little less than half the sauce to a blender or food processor and blitz to a rough paste or smooth depending on preference.  Add this back to the pot along with butter and the balsamic vinegar. Stir to combine until the butter is completely melted.

Serve over noodles with a few cracks of fresh pepper and some chopped parsley or parmesan.


### notes
Can use any type of broth.  Mushroom or chicken broth would be nice. For boxed pasta I prefer *De Cecco* brand and a shape without holes or tubes for the sauce to get stuck in.  Good options are farfalle, oriechette or fettuccine.  Also
goes really well over roasted spaghetti squash. We've been using the pressure cooker method much more and have started to prefer it.

The quality of balsamic matters here. Something with a high density (around 1.3 is good) will be best, and adds a nice sweetness besides the acid. For something widely available, check out the whole foods aged balsamic.
