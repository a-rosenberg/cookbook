### ingredients
- 8-10 oz salmon; something fatty - likely farmed
- 1 cup frozen spinach broken up small or tender asparagus cut into 1" segments
- 1 cup/210g short or medium grain rice (Kokuho); very well rinsed and drained
- 1 1/3 cup water (320g including residual rinsing water)
- 1/2 heaping tsp hondashi
- 1 tsp soy sauce for rice
- 1/4 cup soy sauce for marinating 
- 2-3 green onion; thinly sliced on a bias
- (optional) sesame seeds
- (optional) chili crisp 

### instructions
Add drained rice, hondashi granules and soy sauce to large deep microwave safe dish (with a venting lid). Cover the dish and make sure the venting top is up to allow some steam to escape. Cook for 10 minutes on power level 4, then 10 minutes on power level 3 (this is calibrated for a 1200W microwave). 

While cooking, slice salmon into 1/2‚Äù slabs and marinate in soy sauce. 1/4 cup might be too much so start with 2 tbsp first and add more as needed. Chinese light soy sauce or shoyu will work well. 

When rice is cooked, remove from microwave and without stirring cover evenly in frozen spinach or asparagus - breaking up any large chunks that would cook more slowly. Lay salmon over vegetables with a little bit of the marinade with each piece. Cook on full power for 3:15. Maybe add 15-30 seconds if the fish and vegetables aren't cooked through. Top with green onion, sesame seeds and chili crunch is using. 


### notes
While I use a microwave specific dish (The Anyday large deep bowl), should work with any microwave safe bowl and a top that will trap steam but can still vent enough to not explode.

Make sure to adjust for your microwave. This recipe is refined for 1200W.
