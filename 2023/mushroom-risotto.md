### ingredients
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 1.5 lbs mushrooms; cleaned, trimmed and thinly sliced
- 4 Tbsp olive oil
- 4 Tbsp butter
- 1 yellow onion; chopped
- 4 garlic cloves; minced
- 1.5 cup arborio rice
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce; shoyu, tamari or light chinese
- 1 Tbsp light (shiro) miso
- 1/2 cup sake or white wine
- 1 oz grated high quality parmesan
- more parmesan and any finely minced herb for serving

### instructions
Heat olive and oil and butter in the pressure cooker on sauté mode and add the mushrooms. Cook until mushrooms have softened, but you don't need to take it until they're completely dried and browning - some remaining moisture is fine.

Add onion and garlic and cook until barely softened, then add rice and cook until starting to become translucent around the edges; about 5 minutes. 

Stir in soy sauce and miso paste until distributed then add wine and cook until the alcohol is released; about 2-3 minutes. 

Pour in the broth and stir. Cook on low pressure for 5 minutes (10 psi on most cookers). Release steam valve and open the pressure cooker. If still a little loose, continue to cook on sauté mode while stirring to release more of the rice starch.

Stir in parmesan then check the seasoning. If it's under-seasoned can add a pinch of salt or more soy sauce. Serve with extra grated parmesan and herbs at the table.

### notes
A mixture of mushrooms is nice.
