### ingredients
- 3 Tbsp olive oil
- 3 stalks celery; medium dice
- 4 medium carrots; medium dice
- 1 yellow onion; medium dice
- 2 Tbsp tomato paste
- 8 cups vegetable stock (I prefer better than bouillon)
- 2 15 oz cans chickpeas; drained and rinsed
- 8 oz. small pasta (cavatelli, ditalini, oriechette, macaroni, etc.) 
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 Tbsp parsley; minced plus a little more for topping
- parmesan cheese for serving; microplaned or grated

### instructions
Heat oil in a large saucepan or pot over medium-high; add celery, carrot, and onion and cook until soft, 8-10 minutes. Mix tomato paste into the veggies, stirring continously for 1 minute as it cooks. Add stock and chickpeas; simmer 5 minutes. 

Remove half the chickpea and vegetable mix and pur√©e until smooth; return to pan and bring back to a boil. 

Add pasta and cook until al dente, 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and stir in parsley. Serve with parmesan cheese and extra parsley.

### notes
For pasta e ceci "Minestrone Style" add  2 cloves garlic; thinly sliced, 1 large zucchini; small dice, 1 Tbsp shiro miso paste, and an extra cup or two of broth.
