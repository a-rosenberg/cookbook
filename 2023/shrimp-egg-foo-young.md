### ingredients
- 6-8 oz shrimp; peeled, deveined and patted dry
- 1 cup mung bean sprouts
- 3 green onion; sliced into 2" chunks, white parts sliced in half lengthwise. 
- 4 eggs
- 1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil
- salt
- sugar
- corn starch
- white pepper
- (optional) 1/4 cup water
- (optional) 2 tsp sugar
- (optional) 2 tsp oyster sauce
- (optional) 1 tsp soy sauce

### instructions
Prepare the shrimp. mix shrimp with 1/8 tsp salt, 1/8 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp corn starch and a few cracks of white pepper.

Prepare the eggs. In a large bowl, mix eggs, sesame oil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp sugar, and a few cracks of white pepper. Mix 2.5 tsp of corn starch with 1 Tbsp water then mix into egg mixture for 30 seconds. 

(optional) Make the sauce. Mix the water, sugar, oyster sauce and soy sauce in a small saucepan and heat over medium-low. Simmer for 2-3 minutes until the sauce reduces by about half. Turn off heat and set aside.

Heat a ~10" pan (or wok) over high heat into very hot then add 1 Tbsp of oil and cook the shrimp for about 20-30 seconds a side.  Just enough to bring them to 75% cooked.

Place the par-cooked shrimp in the egg mixture with sprouts and green onion and mix well. Wipe out the pan and reheat over high. Once hot add 2-3 Tbsp oil and then add the egg mixture, spreading it to about 8-9" in diameter.

When the eggs are almost cooked through and nicely browned, carefully flip and cook the other side for 1-2 more minutes.

Remove from the pan and serve with the sauce as a drizzle.

A classic Christmas Eve dinner.
