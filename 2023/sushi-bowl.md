### ingredients
- 3 rice cooker cups of white short or medium grain rice 
- 4 Tbsp rice vinegar 
- 3 Tbsp (scant) sugar 
- 1 tsp kosher salt 
- 4 Tbsp kewpie mayonnaise 
- 2 Tbsp sriracha (or similar hot sauce)
- 12-16 oz smoked slab salmon
- 1-2 avocado; cubed
- 1 cucumber thinly sliced and tossed with small amount of salt and sugar (or 1 recipe of smashed cucumbers)
- roasted, seasoned seaweed squares
- pickled red onion, radish or jalape√±o
- white and black toasted sesame seeds 
- (optional) broiled asparagus; cut into 1" chunks

### instructions
Start by cooking the rice in a rice cooker on the sushi (or white) setting. Make rice seasoning while it cooks by combining and stirring the rice vinegar, sugar and salt in a small mason jar. If not dissolving well, you can put the seasoning mixture in the microwave for 20 seconds then go back to stirring.

When the rice finishes cooking, remove the pot from the cooker and mix in the seasoning blend, careful to chop through the rice while mixing instead of crushing the rice grains. You can move it out of the pot into a broad container to make it cool quickly which achieves a shinier texture.

Make the spicy mayo by mixing together the mayonnaise and sriracha. With kewpie mayo it should be drizzle-able. A small amount of water or sesame oil can be added to thin the sauce if needed. You can also just add a drizzle of kewpie and sriracha directly to the top of the assembled bowl with similar effect (the weeknight technique).

Break apart salmon and place on top of the seasoned rice. Add the toppings around the salmon in the center of the bowl. Drizzle with sauce then sesame seeds. Use the seaweed as a vessel to scoop or assemble bites of the rice bowl.

### notes
Pretty much any vegetable works with this.
