### ingredients
- 1-2 cups cooked short or medium grain white rice
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp shoyu; or any type of soy sauce
- 1 tsp mirin 
- 1 pinch salt 
- 1 smaller pinch MSG
- (optional) asparagus
- (optional) nori
- (optional) furikake
- (optional) kimchi

### instructions
Heat white rice in microwave, covered, until piping hot; about 1-1.5 minutes at full power. 

Make a small divot in the middle of the rice and crack in egg. Add the rest of the non-optional ingredients. Whisk with chopsticks until well emulsified, light and creamy. 

Top with the optional ingredients. 


### notes
If using leftover sushi rice just add a tiny bit of shoyu and MSG -- the mirin and pinch of salt would make it too sweet and salty.

If going for something really decadent, you can top with a second egg yolk once mixed.

Could probably use a semi-brown haiga rice for this dish as well.
