### ingredients
- 16 oz dried pasta; rigatoni or similar (probably not spaghetti, etc)
- 1 yellow onion; small dice
- 2 zucchini; small dice
- 4 cloves garlic; crushed and thinly sliced (or minced)
- 2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 jar (~25 oz) tomato basil sauce
- 2 Tbsp butter 
- 1 oz parmesan; grated
- red pepper flakes
- black pepper
- salt to taste
- (optional) parsley; minced for garnish 

### instructions
Bring salted water to a boil and add pasta once it's rolling. 

While it's coming up, heat a large pan over medium heat and add olive oil then onion. Cook for a couple of minutes, tossing, then add zucchini. Add a small pinch of salt and cook for 5-10 minutes until getting some light browning on the zucchini. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and toss. 

Cook for 1 more minute then add jar of sauce. Add a small scoop of starchy pasta water to rinse the jar back into the pan. Simmer for 5 minutes for the flavors to combine and thicken then add the butter and stir until combined. Once pasta is just before al dente, add it to the pan and finish cooking in the sauce. Once pasta is al dente, take off heat and mix in cheese. Garnish with parsley if using.


### notes
In the summer we often add fresh corn and basil.
