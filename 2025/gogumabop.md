### ingredients
- 2 rice cooker Cups short or medium-grain rice
- 2 small to medium sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed 1/2"  
- 1/2 Cup green onion, thinly sliced  
- 1/4 Cup soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tsp honey
- 1 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds  
- 1/2 tsp gochugaru or similar chili flake  
- (optional) toasted seaweed squares
- (optional) toppings: fried egg, avocado, cherry tomatoes, kimchi  

### instructions
1. Rinse and fill water for rice as normal in an electric rice cooker.  
2. Top with cubed sweet potato and cook.
3. While the rice is cooking, combine the rest of the ingredients in a mason jar and shake to combine/dissolve.
4. When rice is done cooking, stir to incorporate sweet potato.  
5. Serve topped with a few spoonfuls of the sauce.

### notes
- Serves 2–4.
- Mixing the sauce into all of the rice completely is also fine.  
- To scale for 4–6, use 3 Asian cups of rice and 1.5 lbs sweet potato, then double the sauce at 100%.
