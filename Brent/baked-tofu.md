### ingredients
- 1 block super firm tofu
- 1 Tbsp oil
- 2 Tbsp soy sauce or liquid aminos
- 1 Tbsp corn starch

### instructions
1. Slice tofu into 2 or 3 slabs or cut into cubes. Optionally, press out any extra moisture with a dish towel.
2. Mix sauce from remaining ingredients then soak tofu.
3. Preheat oven to 400°F and let the tofu marinate while it’s heating.
4. When oven is hot, place on a large sheet pan lined with parchment or Silpat.
5. Cook for 25-30 minutes, flipping in the middle.

### notes
- This is lighty seasoned and ready for use in other recipes. 
- I like to use this on rice bowls with vegetables and a peanut sauce.
