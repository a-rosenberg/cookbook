### ingredients
- 1 lb broccoli; rinsed and chopped (including the peeled stems)
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 2 cups water
- 3 cloves garlic; minced
- 1 small pinch red pepper flakes
- 5-10 cracks of black pepper
- 5 oz orzo pasta (approx 3/4 cup)
- 4 - 6 oz feta cheese; crumbled

### instructions
In a medium pot combine the broccoli, garlic, broth, water and peppers. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover your pot and cook for 30 minutes.

Using a potato masher, gently smash the broccoli until reaching desired texture. Add the orzo and red pepper and cook uncovered, stirring frequently until pasta is cooked (about 10 minutes). The pasta will stick if left unattended for too long.

Remove the pot from heat and crumble in your feta. Mix it in. Season with salt if needed (ours had enough from the feta and broth).

Serve with a crusty bread. 


### notes
Double it because it's better the next day. Could add lemon juice if the feta isn't acidic enough (dependent on the brand and dry vs. brined).
