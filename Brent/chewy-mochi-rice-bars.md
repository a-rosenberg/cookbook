### ingredients
- 1/2 Cup mochi flour
- 1/2 Cup water or almond milk
- 2 Tbsp butter, sliced
- 2 Tbsp maple syrup
- 2 Cups puffed brown rice (aka brown rice crisps)
- (optional) 1/4 Cup unsweetened shredded coconut
- Pinch of salt

### instructions
1. Mix together flour, liquid, butter, salt, and syrup in a large microwave-safe bowl (large so we can mix in the rice and coconut later).
2. Microwave covered on high (1200W) for 1 minute.
3. Stir to finish melting the butter.
4. Cook again for 2 minutes on high.
5. Mix brown rice and coconut until evenly combined.
6. Place mixture on a buttered sheet pan or plain parchment paper in the desired shape. I like a rectangle that I can cut into 4 smaller rectangle bars (see photo on 1/4 pan).

### notes
For a ride, I like to take a couple in a folded-over piece of parchment paper inside a Stasher bag.
