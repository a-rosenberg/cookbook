### ingredients
- 1 Cup (200g) whole or semi-pearled farro  
- 1 Tbsp olive oil  
- 1 medium red onion or 2 shallots, thinly sliced  
- 8 oz (225g) shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps sliced  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 4 Cups (280g) small broccoli florets  
- ½ Cup (120ml) vegetable broth  
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce  
- ¼ Cup (25g) grated vegan parmesan cheese (or regular parmesan if not vegan)  
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste  

### instructions
1. Cook the farro by rinsing it under cold water. Combine it with water and a pinch of salt. Use a 1:3 ratio of farro to water. Boil over high heat, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 25 minutes for semi-pearled farro or up to 40 minutes for whole farro). Drain any excess water and set aside.

2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sliced onion or shallots and cook until softened, about 3–4 minutes. Add sliced shiitake mushrooms and cook until they release moisture and reduce in volume, about 5–7 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute.

3. Add the broccoli florets to the skillet along with vegetable broth and soy sauce. Stir to combine, cover the skillet, and reduce heat to medium. Steam the broccoli until tender, about 5–7 minutes.

4. Remove the skillet from heat. Stir in the cooked farro and grated vegan parmesan cheese until well combined. Season with freshly ground black pepper to taste. Serve warm.
