### ingredients
- 1 lb brussels sprouts; bottoms trimmed and cut in half  
- 2 Tbsp olive oil; maybe more  
- 2 Tbsp maple syrup  
- 1-2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar  
- salt and pepper to taste  

### instructions
1. Heat a broad pan over medium heat.  
2. Add olive oil, then add Brussels sprouts with salt and pepper. Stir only occasionally to allow browning to develop.  
3. Once tender throughout, add maple syrup and balsamic vinegar.  
4. Stir almost continuously to prevent burning and cook until sprouts are well coated and the sauce thickens slightly.  
5. Turn off heat but keep in the pan for serving to keep them warm.  

### notes
- I like a thicker, aged balsamic vinegar for this recipe.
