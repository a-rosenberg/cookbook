### ingredients
- 2 Tbsp neutral oil
- 1 bunch swiss chard; leaves sliced, stems removed and chopped.
- 3 cloves garlic; smashed under flat knife blade then thinly sliced
- 2 Tbsp miso paste, light or medium
- 1 tsp rice vinegar
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)

### instructions
Cook stems in oil over medium-low heat until the stems are just starting to soften but still have some bite. 

Add garlic (and red pepper flakes if using) and simmer while stirring for another minute. Add chard leaves and stir while cooking until they begin to release water. 

Add miso paste and rice vinegar and stir to evenly combine into the chard water. If it's too dry add a couple tablespoons. Cook until most of the water evaporates and the chard is in a sticky sauce. 

Add more miso or vinegar as needed.

### notes
Chard is easily replaced with lacinato (dinosaur) kale. Cut out and discard stems. The rest of the instructions are the same.
