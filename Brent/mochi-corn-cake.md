### ingredients
- 2.5 cups corn kernels, preferably fresh cut from 2-3 cobs
- 1/2 cup full fat coconut milk
- 1/4 cup butter, melted and cooled slightly, plus more for greasing baking pan
- 3/4 scant cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups glutinous rice flour (I use Koda Farms Blue Star Mochiko)
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt

### instructions
Preheat oven to 350F non-convection.  Grease a 8x8 or 9x9 square or round pan. Blend corn and coconut milk until very smooth.  Blend in the remaining ingredients until smooth again.  Pour into greased baking tray and knock out bubbles.

Bake for 45-60 minutes, until the center is set but bounces back when pushed, and edges are golden brown.  Let cool completely then cut.  Store on counter up to 24 hours or fridge for longer.
