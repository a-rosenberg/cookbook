### ingredients
- 4-5 cups cabbage; thinly sliced
- 1 large carrot; shredded
- 1 cup flour; 1/4 cup at a time
- 2 Tbsp shoyu (soy sauce)
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 eggs
- 2 green onion; white and green separated
- neutral oil; e.g., avocado oil
- kewpie mayonnaise
- sriracha

### instructions
Make the wet batter by whisking together eggs, water, sesame oil and shoyu. Add flour 1/4 cup at a time while whisking until smooth. Add shredded cabbage, carrot and onion whites. 

Let sit for a few minutes for the flour to hydrate. Cook over medium heat with 1 Tbsp neutral oil per pancake. Optionally drain on a paper towel then, non-optionally, serve with a drizzle of kewpie and sriracha and the remaining green onions.
 
### notes
I like this served with a little pile of diced kimchi.
