### ingredients
- 1 large cucumber; half peeled in stripes lengthwise if it has tough skin
- salt
- sugar
- gochugaru
- soy sauce; chinese light or shoyu
- 1 garlic clove; minced
- 1-2 tsp neutral oil; such as avocado oil

### instructions
Cut the cucumber into manageable pieces (3-4") but cutting across then quarter lengthwise. Lightly smash each cucumber quarter seed side down with the flat part of the knife - going up and down the cucumber. Flip the segment over and remove any loose seed and pulp that started to separate from the smashing. Cut the cucumber at an approximately 45 degree bias into 1/4" wide strips. Toss these in a large mixing bowl.

Add a large pinch of salt and sugar to the cucumber pieces and stir well. Add a small pinch the gochugaru flakes, the garlic, a little oil and a splash of the soy sauce. Stir very well then put in the fridge to rest for at least 20 minutes and up to a few hours.

Before serving, check the seasoning and add salt, sugar, gochugaru or soy sauce as needed.

### notes
An english or persian style cucumber won't need to be peeled in stripes - only a tough skinned slicing type will. 

Nice at room temperature too. Can substitute toasted sesame oil for the neutral oil.
