### ingredients
- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1.5 cups just boiled water
- 1-2 Tbsp neutral oil or coconut oil
- 1 pinch salt (~3/4 tsp salt)
- (optional) spices: panch puran (indian five spice blend), cumin seeds, mustard seeds, curry leaves, cloves, cinnamon stick

### instructions
Rinse rice under cold water to remove starch then cover in cold water and let sit for at least 20 minutes, ideally 40 minutes, up to one hour.

Heat oil in a broad pan (at least 12-14").  If using spices, add to the hot oil and fry until fragrant. Add drained rice and the salt and toss to coat in the oil.  Dump in just boiling water and bring pan to an aggresive boil. 

Once boiling, cover, turn heat down to the stovetop's lowest setting and let cook for 10 minutes. Keeping top on, remove from heat and let steam in residual heat for another 10 minutes.

### notes
Can be doubled, but reduce to 2.5 cups boiling water (instead of 3).
