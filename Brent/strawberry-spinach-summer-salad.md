- 1/4 tsp cracked pepper

### instructions
Mix all ingredients from vinegar to black pepper in a mason jar. Cover the jar and shake to emulsify. Store in the fridge while preparing the salad ingredients.

When all the components are ready, start by gently tossing the dried spinach leaves with the dressing - starting with about 3/4 of the dressing volume. add a small pinch of salt then layer in the other ingredients without crushing the greens. 

Serve with extra dressing and any leftover feta cheese.

Delicious, but doesn't keep well. Best for a crowd who will finish it.
