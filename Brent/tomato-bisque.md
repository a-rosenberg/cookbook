### ingredients
- olive oil  
- 1 (28 oz) can whole tomatoes (Bianco DiNapoli recommended)  
- 1 (15 oz) can full-fat coconut milk  
- 1 onion; diced  
- 3-4 garlic cloves; sliced  
- salt and pepper  
- maple syrup  
- 1 red bell pepper; cut into chunks (optional)  

### instructions
1. Heat a few glugs of olive oil in a pot over medium heat.  
2. Add onion and cook until browning and caramelizing, about 10 minutes. Optionally, add red bell pepper. A little salt may help the onions break down.  
3. Add garlic and cook for 2-3 minutes.  
4. Add tomatoes and break them into smaller pieces using a meat masher or potato masher. Simmer for a few minutes.  
5. Add coconut milk and a few cracks of pepper. Bring to a simmer for 5-10 minutes.  
6. Use a stick blender to blend to desired consistency.  
7. Simmer for another 5-15 minutes, keeping the temperature low to prevent burning.  
8. Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and maple syrup as needed (about 1 tsp of maple syrup recommended).  

### notes
- Should be served with grilled cheese. A better option is grilled cheese with kimchi or sauerkraut.
- Simmering longer will develop a deeper flavor.  
- Cooking times are approximate; keep the temperature low to prevent burning. 
- Can be doubled at 100%.
