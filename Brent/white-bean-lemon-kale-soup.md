### ingredients
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 medium yellow onion; small dice
- 2 medium carrot; small dice
- 2 stick celery; small dice
- 4 cloves garlic; minced
- chili flakes or aleppo pepper to taste
- 2-3 sprig fresh rosemary; minced
- 3-4 cans navy beans; drained and rinsed (or 1-2 lbs soaked overnight and pressure cooked 20 min, natural pressure release)
- 8 cups vegetable stock
- 2-4 Tbsp fresh lemon juice
- sea salt and ground black pepper to taste
- 6 cups packed chopped lacinato or curly kale (roughly 2 small bunches)
- 1/2 cup flat leaf parsley leaves; chopped

### instructions
Heat the oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, and celery to the pot and stir. Saut√© the vegetables until just softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.

Add the garlic, chili flakes, and rosemary. Stir and cook until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the navy beans to the pot and stir. Add the vegetable stock to the pot and stir once more. Bring the soup to a boil.

Once boiling, ladle 1/3 to 1/2 of the soup into an upright blender. Add the lemon juice to the blender as well. Carefully bring the speed of the blender up to high and blend until totally liquefied. Pour this liquefied portion back into the pot. Season the soup with salt and pepper.

Add the kale to the pot and bring the soup to a boil. Cook until the kale is slightly wilted and bright green. Stir in the chopped parsley then check seasoning. Serve with a fresh baked or toasted rustic bread.
