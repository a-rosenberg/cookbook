Add eggs and olive oil to bowl and process for 30-60 seconds. The contents should come together into a large ball. If the dough isn’t coming coming together add water 1 tbsp at a time and process again for 15 seconds. Once you have a ball, plop the dough onto a cutting board and knead until the ball is relatively smooth and soft. This is typically a minute or two. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes. Once rested it is ready to be rolled into whatever style pasta you’d like notes For a more decadent pasta, replace one whole egg with two yolks. "],

Thin slightly with water to get desired consistency. Add lemon juice as needed. I find this often isn’t necessary with good caper brine. Can be served right away but does well with a sit for the flavors to mingle – maybe 30 minutes. notes Really good massaged into crunchy greens; e.g., romaine hearts, lacinato kale. "],
["jeff-naan.html", "jeff naan", " jeff naan 2.2.2016 jeff’s naan ingredients | instructions | notes ingredients 2 tsp dry active yeast 1 tsp sugar 1/2 cup water 2 1/2 - 3 cups all-purpose flour, divided 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 cup olive oil 1/3 cup plain yogurt (greek works as well) 1 large egg instructions In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and water. Stir to dissolve then let sit for a few minutes or until it is frothy on top. Once frothy, whisk in the oil, yogurt, and egg until evenly combined. In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the salt. Next, pour the bowl of wet ingredients to the flour/salt mixture and stir until well combined. Continue adding flour, a half cup at a time, until you can no longer stir it with a spoon (about 1 to 1.5 cups later). I find this is almost always 2.5 cups of flour total when using king arthur all-purpose flour. At that point, turn the ball of dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead the ball of dough for about 3 minutes, adding small amounts of flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. You’ll end up using between 2.5 to 3 cups flour total. The dough should be smooth and very soft but not sticky. Avoid adding excessive amounts of flour as you knead, as this can make the dough too dry and stiff. Loosely cover the dough and let it rise until double in size (about 1 hour). After it rises, gently flatten the dough into a disc and cut it into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a small ball. Heat a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat (I prefer cast iron for this). Working with one ball at a time, roll it out until it is about 1/4 inch thick or approximately 6 inches in diameter. Place the rolled out dough onto the hot skillet and cook until the bottom is golden brown and large bubbles have formed on the surface. Flip the dough and cook the other side until golden brown as well. Stack the cooked flat bread on a plate and cover with a towel to keep warm as you cook the remaining pieces. Serve plain or brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with notes This is pretty much just the budget bytes homemade naan recipe. These keep well stored in mason jars then reheated on a hot pan like they were cooked. "],

Using one large or two smaller trays, spread out sweet potatoes and delicata squash. Roast for 20 minutes, until browning underneath. Flip and toss. Roast for another 10-20 minutes. Sweet potatoes should be bronzed and tender and squash should be browning at edges. Toss chunks around one more time if it looks like they are cooking unevenly. While potatoes and squash are cooking, heat a pan to medium-low heat. Add 2 Tbsp neutral oil and crimini mushrooms to the pan, cooking until tender. While mushrooms are cooking, prepare japanese braised greens. Jess prefers using lacinato kale for this specific recipe, as opposed to chard. Throw cooked mushrooms into the pan of greens, stir, and cook together on low for another minute. Remove from heat and set aside. Prepare bowls. Before adding vegetables, mix a dash of toasted sesame oil into the cooked rice. Pile on vegetables and top with a fried egg (optional).
