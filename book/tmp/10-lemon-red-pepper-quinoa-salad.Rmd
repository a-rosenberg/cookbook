### ingredients
- 1 cup dry quinoa (about 3 cups cooked)
- 1 3/4 cup water
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp olive oil or butter
- 1 cucumber; small dice
- 1 red pepper; small dice
- 1 small red onion; small dice (maybe 1/2 or 3/4 of a giant one)
- 1 can chickpeas; rinsed and drained
- 1 bunch of parsley, finely chopped 
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 lemon juice (2 or 3 lemons)
- 1 Tbsp sherry vinegar (red wine vinegar could work too)
- 2 garlic cloves; pressed
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt

### instructions
1. Cook the quinoa. Thoroughly rinse dry quinoa while heating oil in medium sized pot over medium heat.  When quinoa 
are washed  and pan hot, add drained quinoa and cook stirring to toast as the remaining water evaporates - about 2-3 
minutes. Stir in water and salt and bring to a rolling boil.  Reduce heat to the lowest setting and cover the pot.  
Cook for 15 minutes without removing the top, then take off heat and let sit, unopened, for 5 more minutes.  
Fluff with a fork and allow to cool some. 
1. While quinoa cooks, prep and combine the ingredients from cucumber to parsley in a large mixing bowl.
1. Make the dressing. Combine ingredients from olive oil to kosher salt in a mason jar.  Put on the lid and give it a good shake.
1. Once the quinoa has cooled a bit as to not cook the veggies, add to the mixing bowl and stir to mix.  Shake the dressing again and pour 
over the mixture while stirring.  It's good now a little warm, and will be good cold out of the fridge for another few days.

### notes
Adapted from a cookie and kate blog recipe. I like the sherry vinegar a lot more than red wine in this application.  As I was making 
it I thought it would need something like feta, but once I tasted it I really don't think that's the case.  Dressing might benefit from 
a pinch of red pepper flakes.  A good camping recipe due to the short cook and cold presentation.
