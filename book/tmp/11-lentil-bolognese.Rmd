### ingredients
- 3 Tbsp olive oil (not extra virgin)
- 2 carrots; small dice
- 1-2 celery stalks; small dice
- 1 onion; small dice
- 1 cup beluga (black) lentils
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 scant Tbsp balsamic vinegar
- pasta, dried or homemade; cooked

### instructions
1. Heat the oil over medium-low heat then add carrots.  Cook for a couple minutes then add onions and celery and cook 
until golden; about 10-15 minutes.
2. Rinse lentils then add to the pot.  Toss around then add the 4 cups of broth.  Bring to a boil over high heat then 
reduce to a simmer and 
allow to cook for 35-45 minutes until the lentils have absorbed much of the water and are abundantly tender.  This is a 
good time to check the seasoning.
3. Remove half the sauce to a blender or food processor and blitz to a rough paste.  Add this back to the pot along with 
butter and the balsamic vinegar.
4. Serve over noodles with a few cracks of fresh pepper and some chopped parsley.

### notes
Can use any type of broth.  Mushroom or chicken broth would be nice. For boxed pasta I prefer *De Cecco* brand and a
shape without holes or tubes for the sauce to get stuck in.  Good options are farfalle, oriechette or fettucine.  Also
goes really well over roasted spaghetti squash.
