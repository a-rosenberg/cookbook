### ingredients
- 2 Tbsp neutral oil
- 1 bunch swiss chard; sliced, stems removed and chopped.
- 3 cloves garlic; smashed under flat knife blade then thinly sliced
- 2 Tbsp miso paste, light or medium
- 1 tsp rice vinegar
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)

### instructions
1. Cook stems in oil over medium low heat until the stems are starting to cook but still firm. 
1. Add garlic (and red pepper flakes if using) and simmer while stirring for another minute. Add chard leaves and 
stir while cooking until begins to release water. 
1. Add miso paste and rice vinegar and stir to evenly combine into the chard water. If it's too dry add a couple 
tablespoons. Cook until most water evaporates and the chard is in a sticky sauce. 
1. Season to taste and serve. Add more miso or vinegar as needed.

### notes
Chard is easily replaced with lacinato (aka dinosaur) kale. Cut out and discard stems. The rest of the directions 
remain the same.
