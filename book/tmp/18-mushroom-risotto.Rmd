### ingredients
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 1.5 lbs assorted mushrooms (a mixture is best); cleaned, trimmed and thinly sliced
- 4 Tbsp olive oil
- 4 Tbsp butter
- 1 yellow onion; chopped
- 4 garlic cloves; minced
- 1.5 cup arborio rice
- 2 tsp tamari or soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp light (shiro) miso
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1 oz grated high quality parmesan
- more parmesan and any finely minced herb for serving
- 1 oz dried porcini or shitake (optional)

### instructions
1. If you have dried mushrooms, heat stock and allow dried mushrooms to steep until soft, about 5 minutes for 
porcinis or up to an hour for shitakes. Remove hydrated mushrooms and roughly chop. Add mushroom scraps to the stock 
and allow to sit until later when the stock is added to the rice. 
1. Heat olive and oil and butter in the pressure cooker and add all of the mushrooms. Cook until the moisture is 
released and the mushrooms are beginning to brown. 
1. Add onion and garlic and cook until barely softened, then add rice and cook until starting to become translucent 
around the edges; about 5 minutes. 
1. Stir in soy/tamari and miso paste until distributed then add wine and cook until the alcohol is released; about 
2-3 minutes. 
1. Pour the stock into the pot through a mesh strainer and discard the mushroom scraps. Cook on low pressure for 5 
minutes (10 psi on most cookers). Release steam valve and open the pressure cooker. 
1. Stir in parmesan and check the seasoning. 
1. Serve with extra grated parmesan and herbs at the table.

### notes
Not a good choice for someone who doesn't like mushrooms.  The dried mushrooms are nice but not necessary - I 
generally skip the extra step. Also, if the rissotto comes out a little too dry, feel free to loosen it with a 
few tablespoons of stock or heavy cream.
