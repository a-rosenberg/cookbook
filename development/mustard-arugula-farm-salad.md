### ingredients
- 2 Tbsp dijon mustard
- 2 Tbsp whole grain mustard (e.g., Maille)
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 Tbsp sherry vinegar (or something similar)
- 1 scant Tbsp maple syrup
- couple cracks of black pepper
- 12-16 oz new potatoes; cooked (boiled or steamed) and cut in half
- 7 oz arugula; washed and dried as much as possible
- 1 1/4 cup uncooked brown rice
- 1/4 cup uncooked wild rice
- 1/4 cup dried cranberries
- 4-6 eggs; quartered lengthwise
- 1/4 cup pine nuts (optional)
- 1 tin sardines or mackerel (optional)

### instructions
1. Combine all the ingredients in the top section in a pint jar with a lid (mason jar).  Shake to create an even mixture then put in the fridge. 
1. Cook the brown and wild rice together.  I like to combine them in a rice cooker and cook via timer overnight to be ready in the morning.
1. Combine potatoes, arugula, rice, pine nuts and cranberries and toss until evenly distributed.  Serve onto plates or into containers
and top with eggs and fish -- should make 4-6 meal sized servings.  When ready to serve, drizzle over two spoonfuls of dressing.  Add more to taste.

### notes
Fish isn't necessary but a nice boost of protein.
