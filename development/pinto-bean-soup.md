### ingredients
- 1 cup dried pinto beans; washed and picked over
- 4 cups water
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 2-3 bay leaves
- sliced avocado 
- shake cayenne pepper
- torn cilantro

### instructions
1. Place beans, water and spices in pressure cooker.  Cook on high 
pressure for 45 minutes and let cool naturally.  The soup is ready now 
or can be kept warm for hours to develop some.
2. Open the pressure cooker and season with salt to taste.  Should be a tasty bean 
broth. *Remove the bay leaves* and use a hand blender to pulse to the desired 
consistency. Heat back up to a simmer while stirring occasionally.
3. Serve hot with sliced avocado, a dash of cayenne and some cilantro leaves.

### notes
Look into doubling this.  Water likely won't scale at 100%.  Current recipe makes about 3 bowls.  Maybe serve with a lime slice?
