  1 small red onion; small dice (maybe 1/2 or 3/4 of a giant one)
\item
  1 can chickpeas; rinsed and drained
\item
  1 bunch of parsley, finely chopped
\item
  1/4 cup olive oil
\item
  1/4 lemon juice (2 or 3 lemons)
\item
  1 Tbsp sherry vinegar (red wine vinegar could work too)
\item
  2 garlic cloves; pressed

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Cook the quinoa. Thoroughly rinse dry quinoa while heating oil in medium sized pot over medium heat. When quinoa
  are washed and pan hot, add drained quinoa and cook stirring to toast as the remaining water evaporates - about 2-3
  minutes. Stir in water and salt and bring to a rolling boil. Reduce heat to the lowest setting and cover the pot.\\
  Cook for 15 minutes without removing the top, then take off heat and let sit, unopened, for 5 more minutes.\\
  Fluff with a fork and allow to cool some.
\item
  While quinoa cooks, prep and combine the ingredients from cucumber to parsley in a large mixing bowl.
\item
  Make the dressing. Combine ingredients from olive oil to kosher salt in a mason jar. Put on the lid and give it a good shake.
\item
  Once the quinoa has cooled a bit as to not cook the veggies, add to the mixing bowl and stir to mix. Shake the dressing again and pour
  over the mixture while stirring. It's good now a little warm, and will be good cold out of the fridge for another few days.

Adapted from a cookie and kate blog recipe. I like the sherry vinegar a lot more than red wine in this application. As I was making
it I thought it would need something like feta, but once I tasted it I really don't think that's the case. Dressing might benefit from
a pinch of red pepper flakes. A good camping recipe due to the short cook and cold presentation.

\item
  Rinse lentils then add to the pot. Toss around then add the 4 cups of broth. Bring to a boil over high heat then
  reduce to a simmer and
  allow to cook for 35-45 minutes until the lentils have absorbed much of the water and are abundantly tender. This is a
  good time to check the seasoning.
\item
  Remove half the sauce to a blender or food processor and blitz to a rough paste. Add this back to the pot along with
  butter and the balsamic vinegar.
\item
  Serve over noodles with a few cracks of fresh pepper and some chopped parsley.
\end{enumerate}

Can use any type of broth. Mushroom or chicken broth would be nice. For boxed pasta I prefer \emph{De Cecco} brand and a
shape without holes or tubes for the sauce to get stuck in. Good options are farfalle, oriechette or fettucine. Also
goes really well over roasted spaghetti squash.

  If you have dried mushrooms, heat stock and allow dried mushrooms to steep until soft, about 5 minutes for
  porcinis or up to an hour for shitakes. Remove hydrated mushrooms and roughly chop. Add mushroom scraps to the stock
  and allow to sit until later when the stock is added to the rice.
\item
  Heat olive and oil and butter in the pressure cooker and add all of the mushrooms. Cook until the moisture is
  released and the mushrooms are beginning to brown.
\item
  Add onion and garlic and cook until barely softened, then add rice and cook until starting to become translucent
  around the edges; about 5 minutes.
\item
  Stir in soy/tamari and miso paste until distributed then add wine and cook until the alcohol is released; about
  2-3 minutes.
\item
  Pour the stock into the pot through a mesh strainer and discard the mushroom scraps. Cook on low pressure for 5
  minutes (10 psi on most cookers). Release steam valve and open the pressure cooker.
\item
  Stir in parmesan and check the seasoning.

Not a good choice for someone who doesn't like mushrooms. The dried mushrooms are nice but not necessary - I
generally skip the extra step. Also, if the rissotto comes out a little too dry, feel free to loosen it with a
few tablespoons of stock or heavy cream.

  Stir 2 TB salt into a 1 quart mason jar until salt is dissolved.
\item
  Add chopped vegetables to the mason jar. Turnips, beets, radishes, carrots are particularly tasty.
\item
  Optionally, add spices, particularly garlic, ginger, peppers (hot or sweet), and onions.
\item
  Cover the mason jar loosely with its lid. If possible, ensure that the vegetables are submerged with the brine: one easy way to do this is to fill a plastic bag with beans and place it on top of the vegetables and brine. Specialized tools also exist. If the vegetables are not completely covered, those that are exposed to the air can be removed before storage.
\item
  Ferment between 2-3 days and 2-3 weeks, or longer. Refrigerate to store with a closed lid.

If possible, use filtered water, as chlorine in water may inhibit lactic acid fermentation. The ratio of 2 TB salt to 1 quart of water can be scaled up or down (i.e., for 1 gallon of water, use 8 TB {[}1/2 cup{]} of salt). Salt can be reduced to taste, especially when a longer time is used for the ferment. Especially in cooler weather, as little as 1 TB salt per quart of water may suffice. This technique works for any vegetable, though leafy greens are known to taste bitter with this method.

  sauce and veggie broth and stir to combine. If using large turnips, cook for 15 minutes to get out any bitterness.\\
  Add lentils and stir again.
\item
  If making the optional crispy, caramelized shallots, add shallots and oil to a pan on medium low. After a few
  minutes the shallots should be sizzling as they release their moisture. Cook while stirring occasionally and continue
  with the stew steps below. About 20 minutes in the shallots should be turning golden. Remove them from the oil and
  spread out on a paper towel lined plate and sprinkle with salt.
\item
  Bring soup to a boil then reduce to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes stirring occasionally. Around then the
  lentils will be a consistent color and texture though and will plump up to fill the pot all of the sudden. At this
  point stir in the herbs if you're using them and the greens and let cook for a couple minutes.

  In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the salt. Next, pour the bowl of wet ingredients
  to the flour/salt mixture and stir until well combined. Continue adding flour, a half cup at a time, until you can
  no longer stir it with a spoon (about 1 to 1.5 cups later). I find this is almost always 2.5 cups of flour total
  when using king arthur all-purpose flour.
\item
  At that point, turn the ball of dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead the ball of dough for about
  3 minutes, adding small amounts of flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. You'll end up using between
  2.5 to 3 cups flour total. The dough should be smooth and very soft but not sticky. Avoid adding excessive amounts
  of flour as you knead, as this can make the dough too dry and stiff.
\item
  Loosely cover the dough and let it rise until double in size (about 1 hour). After it rises, gently flatten the
  dough into a disc and cut it into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a small ball.
\item
  Heat a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat (I prefer cast iron for this). Working with one ball at a time,
  roll it out until it is about 1/4 inch thick or approximately 6 inches in diameter. Place the rolled out dough onto
  the hot skillet and cook until the bottom is golden brown and large bubbles have formed on the surface. Flip the dough
  and cook the other side until golden brown as well. Stack the cooked flat bread on a plate and cover with a towel to
  keep warm as you cook the remaining pieces. Serve plain or brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with

This is pretty much just the budget bytes homemade naan recipe. These keep well stored in mason jars then reheated on
a hot pan like they were cooked.

  Cook rice in a rice cooker on brown setting or on the stove.
\item
  Heat oven to 400F. Peel sweet potatoes and cut into 3/4" cubes. Toss in a 1-2 Tbsp neutral oil with a
  sprinkle of salt. Cut off top of delicata squash, slice length-wise, scoop out inards, and slice into 1/2" wide
  half moons. Again, toss in a neutral oil with a sprinkle of salt. Using one large or two smaller trays, spread
  out sweet potatoes and delicata squash. Roast for 20 minutes, until browning underneath. Flip and toss. Roast for
  another 10-20 minutes. Sweet potatoes should be bronzed and tender and squash should be browning at edges. Toss
  chunks around one more time if it looks like they are cooking unevenly.
\item
  While potatoes and squash are cooking, heat a pan to medium-low heat. Add 2 Tbsp neutral oil and crimini mushrooms
  to the pan, cooking until tender. While mushrooms are cooking, prepare japanese braised greens. Jess prefers using
  lacinato kale for this specific recipe, as opposed to chard. Throw cooked mushrooms into the pan of greens, stir, and
  cook together on low for another minute. Remove from heat and set aside.
\item
  Prepare bowls. Before adding vegetables, mix a dash of toasted sesame oil into the cooked rice. Pile on vegetables
  and top with a fried egg (optional). Add tamari/soy sauce and siracha to taste.

Best rice bowl ever. Rice can be cooked on a timer so that it can soak for longer, up to 12 hours.
