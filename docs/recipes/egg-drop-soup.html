      <h2>instructions</h2>
      <ol><li>Bring the stock to a simmer in a medium soup pot. Stir in the sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper, and MSG. Add in the turmeri.</li><li>Taste the soup, and adjust the seasoning if needed.</li><li>Add the cornstarch and water mixture. Make sure the cornstarch and water is mixed well, as the cornstarch settles very quickly. Stir the soup continuously as you drizzle in the slurry, or you&#39;ll get clumps of cooked starch in your soup.</li><li>Use a ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion, and slowly drizzle in the egg until you have added it all.</li><li>Ladle the soup into bowls, top with scallions if desired, and serve hot.</li></ol>

      <h2>notes</h2>
      <p>The speed which you stir while pouring the egg in determines the size of the egg flowers. I prefer large clumps of egg so tend to stir very slowly after some has set.</p>
