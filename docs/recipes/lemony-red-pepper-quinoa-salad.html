      <h2>notes</h2>
      <p>I like the sherry vinegar a lot more than red wine in this application. As I was making it I thought it would need something like feta, but once I tasted it I really don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. Dressing might benefit from a pinch of red pepper flakes. A good camping recipe due to the short cook and cold presentation.</p>
