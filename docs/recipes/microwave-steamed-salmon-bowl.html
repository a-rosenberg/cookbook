      <h2>instructions</h2>
      <ol><li>Add drained rice, hondashi granules and soy sauce to large deep Anyday microwave dish. Cook for 10 minutes on power level 4, then 10 minutes on power level 3.</li><li>While cooking, slice salmon into 1/2” slabs and marinate in soy sauce. 1/4 cup might be too much so start with 2 tbsp first and add more as needed. Chinese light soy sauce worked well.</li><li>When rice is cooked, remove from microwave and without stirring cover evenly in frozen spinach or asparagus - breaking up any large chunks that would cook more slowly. Lay salmon over vegetables with a little bit of the marinade with each piece. Cook on full power (1200W is what we have) for 3:15. Maybe add 15–30 seconds to make fish and vegetables are cooked through. Top with green onion, and sesame seeds or chili crunch is using.</li></ol>

      <h2>notes</h2>
      <p>While I use a microwave specific dish, should work with any microwave safe bowl and a top that will trap steam but can still vent enough to not explode.</p>
