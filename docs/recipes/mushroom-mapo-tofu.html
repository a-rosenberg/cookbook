      <h2>instructions</h2>
      <ol><li>Drain the shitake mushrooms (reserving the soaking liquid) and finely chop them along with the fresh mushrooms - discarding any hard stems. Have all the mise en place ready before starting cooking.</li><li>Bring a pot of salted water to boil and poach the tofu. Drain, lightly season with salt and keep warm.</li><li>Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large deep pan or a wok over high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, turning over every once in a while so that everything cooks and browns.</li><li>Once the mushrooms release their liquid, and it evaporates, add the leek, garlic and ginger and cook for 3 minutes. Scoop the vegetables out of the wok and wipe clean if needed.</li><li>Add another 1 Tbsp oil to the pan/wok and put it back on high heat.  Add the doubanjiang, chili crisp, black bean, sichuan pepper (if using), and gochugaru flakes.  Fry, stirring continuously so it doesn&#39;t burn, until the oil separates from the mixture - about 1 minute.</li><li>Stir the mushroom soaking liquid into the hot mixture, then add the vegetables and bring to a boil. Add the cornstarch slurry and boil again.  Stir in the tofu cubes and stir carefully to coat.</li><li>Serve with rice.</li></ol>
