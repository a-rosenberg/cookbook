      <h2>notes</h2>
      <p>Lotus brown rice and millet ramen both work great; Momofuku chili crunch is an excellent topping. For extra flavor, try adding a few slices of fresh ginger to the broth and garnish with thinly sliced green onions. Can also be made without coconut milk - just add extra broth.</p>
