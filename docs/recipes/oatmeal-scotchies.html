      <h2>instructions</h2>
      <ol><li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.

Beat on high speed until combined, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.</li><li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined.</li><li>With the mixer on low speed, beat in the oats and butterscotch morsels until evenly distributed. The dough will be thick and sticky.</li><li>Cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes, or up to 4 days. Chilling is mandatory for this cookie dough.</li><li>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li><li>Scoop about 3 Tbsp of dough per cookie and roll into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 3 inches apart.</li><li>Bake the cookies for 12–14 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned. The centers will look soft and undercooked.</li><li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li></ol>

      <h2>notes</h2>
      <p>- **Storage:** Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. - **Make-Ahead Instructions:** You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes before baking. Baked cookies freeze well for up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well for up to 3 months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute; no need to thaw. - **Molasses:** Avoid using blackstrap molasses, as it is too bitter for this recipe. - **Oats:** Use old-fashioned whole rolled oats for the best texture. Quick oats are too fine and will make the cookies dry. - **Butterscotch Morsels:** Ensure they are fresh and not stale for the best flavor and texture.</p>
