      <h2>notes</h2>
      <p>Goes well with baguette or naan. Can add lots of different veggies to the base: carrots, radishes, green beans, eggplant, etc. Also goes well with a drizzle of tahini sauce. Goya makes the best canned chickpeas. I like sprinkling on some Trader Joe&#39;s &#34;Everything But the Bagel&#34; spice mixture on top. Can also add a green with the chickpeas like lacinato kale or de-stemmed swiss chard.</p>
