      <h2>instructions</h2>
      <ol><li>Heat pan on medium flame then add oil and onion (and red pepper flakes if using). Cook until onion begins to soften then add garlic and cook until</li><li>Add lentils and stir again.  If using collard greens, add with lentils.  Bring soup to a boil then reduce to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes stirring occasionally. Around then the lentils will be a consistent color and texture though and will plump up to fill the pot all of the sudden.</li><li>*If making the optional crispy, caramelized shallots, add shallots and oil to a pan on medium low.  After a few minutes the shallots should be sizzling as they release their moisture.  Cook while stirring occasionally and continue with the stew steps below. About 20 minutes in the shallots should be turning golden. Remove them from the oil and spread out on a paper towel lined plate and sprinkle with salt.*</li><li>Once lentils are cooked, stir in the herbs (if using) and greens and let cook for a couple minutes.</li><li>Taste the soup- if it lacks body, add vegetable broth base 1/2 tsp at a time, or maybe a pinch of salt if it just</li></ol>
