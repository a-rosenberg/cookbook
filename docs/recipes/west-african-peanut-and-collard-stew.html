      <h2>instructions</h2>
      <ol><li>Sauté the ginger and garlic in neutral oil over medium heat for 1–2 minutes, or until the garlic becomes soft and fragrant.</li><li>Add onion the pot, and continue to sauté. Add sweet potato to the pot, and continue to sauté a few minutes more, or until the onion is soft and the sweet potato takes on a darker, slightly translucent appearance. Season with cumin and red pepper flakes.</li><li>Add the tomato paste and peanut butter, and stir until everything is evenly mixed. Add the vegetable broth and stir to dissolve the thick tomato paste-peanut butter mixture. Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to high.</li><li>While the soup is coming up to a boil, prepare the collard greens. Rinse the greens well, then use a sharp knife to remove each stem (cut along the side of each stem). Stack the leaves, then cut them into thin strips. Add the collard strips to the soup pot.</li><li>Once the soup reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and allow it to simmer without a lid for about 15 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are very soft. Once soft, smash about half of the sweet potatoes with the back of a wooden spoon to help thicken the soup.</li><li>Taste the soup and add salt if needed (will depend on the brand of broth used). Serve the stew hot with a few cilantro leaves if desired.</li></ol>
