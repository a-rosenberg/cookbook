### ingredients
- 8 eggs
- 1/4 cup milk; almond or cow's
- 2 cloves garlic; minced
- extra virgin olive oil
- 2 bunches brocollini; about 3 cups in bite sized pieces
- 6 green onions or 1/2 yellow onion; sliced
- 1/4 - 1/2 cup feta; crumbled
- small pinch smoked paprika
- red pepper flakes
- salt and pepper

### instructions
Preheat oven to 400F. Whisk together eggs, milk and garlic cloves with some salt and pepper. Heat a 12" cast iron pan and add 1-2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil. If using yellow/sweet onion cook it for 5-10 minutes until lightly browned and caramelizing. Can add a tiny pinch of sugar to encourage the caramelization. If using green onion, add them and the broccolini together and cook until tender - 4 to 8 minutes. Season with salt and add the pinch of smoked paprika. Stir until evenly distributed along the bottom of the pan. 

Add eggs to the pan and shake if needed until distributed. Sprinkle on feta cheese and a small pinch of red pepper flakes. Place in lower or middle rack in the oven and cook for 15 minutes. Add 2-3 minutes if eggs are not yet set. Can move to a higher rack to encourage browning near the end for 2 minutes or just turn on broiler while on same rack it was on for 2 minutes. Let cool and set for 10 to 15 minutes if possible. Can serve warm, at room temperature or reheat in an oven by letting the frittata come up to temp with oven to 350F.

### notes
Easy to swap the veggies from broccolini to asparagus, red pepper, etc. Be careful if using mushrooms to fully cook out the moisture or it will be released in the oven and turn the frittata grey.
