### ingredients
- 2 medium sweet potatoes or equivalent in small potatoes; peeled and diced 
- 2 green onions; sliced
- tortillas 
- feta cheese 
- kale; stems removed and thinly sliced 
- 1 tsp better than bouillon concentrate 
- extra virgin olive oil
- salt and pepper 
- (optional) black beans; drained and rinsed 
- (optional) cooked and sliced beets 
- (optional) sliced avocado

### instructions
Toss potatoes with olive oil and salt. Microwave in covered container until tender -- 5-10 minutes depending on volume. Once tender, add green onions and mash. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. While the potatoes cook, saut√© kale in a little olive oil. Once the initial moisture is released, add bouillon base and 1/2 - 1 cup of water. Cook until the water evaporates leaving seasoned, very tender kale. 

Preheat pan for quesadilla. Add a touch of oil if using a stainless pan. Spread potato mixture over half. Top with kale and feta. Add optional black beans or beets too. Once mostly cooked fold in half and get a little time on other side of the quesadilla before removing and slicing. 

Preheat oven to 350F non-convection.  Grease a 8x8 or 9x9 square or round pan. Blend corn and coconut milk until very smooth.  Blend in the remaining ingredients until smooth again.  Pour into greased baking tray and knock out bubbles.

Bake for 45-60 minutes, until the center is set but bounces back when pushed, and edges are golden brown.  Let cool completely then cut.  Store on counter up to 24 hours or fridge for longer. 

### notes
Can cook the sweet potatoes, not mash them, and use them as chunks in a cheese quesadilla with the black beans and kale.
