### ingredients
- 8 tomatillos; paper wrappers and stems removed
- 1/4 white onion
- 1 jalapeño; stem removed and halved
- 1 clove garlic; skin on
- 1 handful cilantro

### instructions
Heat oven to 450F. Add convection if it’s an option. 

Add washed tomatillos, onion, garlic clove and jalapeño to a baking sheet (a quarter sheet fits everything well). Bake checking every few minutes and rotating to distribute browning (8-15 minutes total). 

Once browned and maybe a little charred, remove and add to a blender - making sure to remove garlic peel. Add cilantro and a pinch of salt then pulse to desired consistency. Check seasoning. 

Let it cool a little in the fridge before serving as the pectin from the tomatillos will cause it to thicken.

### notes
I love this in and on bean and cheese quesadillas
