### ingredients
- 1 small shallot; minced
- 3 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 tsp smooth dijon mustard
- 1 Tbsp mayonnaise
- 6 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- salt and pepper
- 1 cup (115 grams or 4 ounces) sharp cheddar; coarsely grated
- 1 cup sliced almonds
- 2 Tbsp (15 grams) powdered sugar
- 1/4 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp ground cayenne
- 5 ounces (140 grams) kale leaves, any variety, cut into thin ribbons
- 1 large crisp apple; halved, cored, and cut thin

### instructions
Heat oven to 400F.

Add shallots, vinegar, dijon, mayo (or yogurt), and olive oil to a mason jar. Season with salt and pepper. Shake well to homogenize.

For the cheddar crisps and candied almonds, line a half-sheet baking sheet with parchment paper. Scatter cheddar evenly over half the parchment, in about a 1/4-inch deep rectangle. Sprinkle with a little cayenne or black pepper.

Rinse almonds under cold water and shake off excess liquid. In a bowl, toss wet almonds with powdered sugar, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon cayenne until evenly coated. Spread on second half of parchment-covered baking sheet in a thin, even layer.

Bake almonds and cheddar together for 4 to 9 minutes, until the cheese is melted into a lacy, evenly deep golden brown crisp and the almonds are dark at the edges and lightly golden throughout. Watch it closely as both the cheddar and the almonds will go from raw to burnt quite quickly. Check it at 4 minutes, then every minute or two after until the pan is just right. Remove and let cool while you finish the salad.

Assemble in a large wide bowl. Toss greens with 2/3 the dressing to start, then tasting and adding the rest if needed. Arrange the apple over the greens, fanning out slices. Break off clustered of almonds from the baking sheet and scatter them over the salad. If the cheddar crisp are oily, you can blot it with a paper towel, before tearing or cutting it into large bite-size pieces and scattering them over the salad. 

Season the salad with additional salt and pepper and serve right away. 

### notes
The method for candied almonds is ridiculously good. This recipe is essentially unaltered from the Smitten Kitchen blog.
