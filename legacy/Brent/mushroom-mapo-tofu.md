### ingredients
- 1-2 oz dried shitake mushrooms; soaked in 4 cups water
- 12 oz crimini mushrooms
- 2 lb soft/silken or firm tofu; cut into 1" cubes
- 2 leeks; halved lengthwise, washed and sliced into 1" pieces on an angle
- 2 Tbsp ginger; minced
- 2 Tbsp garlic; minced 
- 2 tsp gochugaru
- 4 Tbsp doubanjiang
- (optional) 2 tsp whole sichuan peppercorn; crushed or ground fresh
- 3 Tbsp chili crisp; I prefer Momofuku brand
- 2 Tbsp fermented black bean paste
- 2 Tbsp corn starch mixed with 2 Tbsp cold water to form a slurry

### instructions
Prepare and measure out all the ingredients before starting to cook because it goes fast. Drain the shiitake mushrooms (reserving the soaking liquid) and finely chop them along with the fresh mushrooms - discarding any hard stems. Bring a pot of salted water to boil and poach the tofu. Drain, lightly season with salt and keep warm.

Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large deep pan or a wok over high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, turning over every once in a while so that everything cooks and begins to brown. Once the mushrooms release their liquid, and it largely evaporates, add the leek, garlic and ginger and cook for 3 minutes. Scoop the vegetables out of the wok and wipe clean if needed.

Add another 1 Tbsp oil to the pan/wok and put it back on high heat.  Add the doubanjiang, chili crisp, black bean, sichuan pepper (if using), and gochugaru flakes.  Fry, stirring continuously, so it doesn't burn, until the oil separates from the mixture - about 1 minute.

Stir the mushroom soaking liquid into the hot mixture, then add the vegetables and bring to a boil. Add the cornstarch slurry and boil again.  Stir in the tofu cubes and stir carefully to coat.

Serve with rice.

### notes
Traditionally made with silken/soft tofu; however, we've used firm tofu lately and like it more. Avoid extra firm tofu.

A lot of these ingredients will have to be acquired from the asian grocery store; e.g., H-mart. Goes well with cold cucumber (i.e., cooling) dishes.
