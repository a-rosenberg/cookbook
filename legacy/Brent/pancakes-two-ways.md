They're both delicious. I think I prefer the texture of way 1 better, but the flavor of way 2. Can't go wrong with either.

## way 1: the classic

- 1.5 cups flour (225 g)
- 0.5 cup almond flour (60g)
- 1/4 tsp salt 
- 2 tsp baking powder (12 g)
- 1 Tbsp sugar 
- 2 eggs 
- 1.5 cups almond milk 


### instructions
Mix wet and dry separately then bring together until just hydrated. Don’t over mix, small clumps are ok. Cook over medium in cast iron or non-stick with some butter. 

## way 2: banana mashed

### ingredients
- 3 ripe bananas 
- 3 eggs 
- almond flour
- 1 scant tsp baking powder
- salt (optional)
- neutral or coconut oil 

### instructions
Mash bananas with a fork until they’re pudding. Mix in the eggs. Add flour until good pancake consistency (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup). Add baking powder and stir or whisk in. Add a pinch of salt if desired. Cook with oil.

Can be scaled to any number of equal bananas and eggs easily.
