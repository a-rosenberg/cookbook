### ingredients
- 1 Tbsp oil; extra virgin olive oil or avocado 
- 1 cup quinoa
- 1.75 cup vegetable broth or water (see note); ideally hot.

### instructions
Set a medium saucepan over medium heat. Rinse the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer and drain well. Add the oil to the saucepan and then the quinoa, stirring frequently to let the remaining water evaporate and the quinoa to toast. 2-3 minutes. You should just begin to smell the quinoa toasting.

Stir in the broth and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover the pan and reduce to the stovetop's lowest heat level. Leave to cook, undisturbed for 15 minutes.

Turn off heat but leave covered for 5 more minutes. Then fluff with a fork and let the residual steam evaporate, uncovered. Should be ready to serve in 5 minutes.

### notes
If you don't have broth it's fine to substitute with water and 1/2 tsp kosher salt.
