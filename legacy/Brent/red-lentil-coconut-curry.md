### ingredients
- 2 Tbsp coconut oil
- 1 onion; medium dice
- 2 cloves garlic; crushed or minced 
- 2‚Äù knob of ginger; minced 
- 1 cup split red lentils (masoor dal); well rinsed
- 1 14oz can crushed tomatoes
- 1 cup cilantro stems
- 1/4 cup cilantro leaves
- 1 14 oz can full fat coconut milk
- 2.5 cups water
- (optional) 2-3 oz baby spinach
- 1 tablespoon curry powder
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- 1/2 lemon


### instructions
Preheat saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and fry for 8 minutes, sitting frequently, until soft and caramelized.  Add curry powder, pepper flakes, garlic and ginger and fry for 1-2 more minutes, stirring continuously. 

Add lentils and stir for 1 minute, then add tomatoes, cilantro stems, water, 1 tsp salt and a big grind of pepper.

Add the coconut milk, reserving a few Tbsp if desired for finishing. Bring to a boil then simmer for 25-30 minutes, until the lentils are soft but still holding a little shape. Fold in spinach and take off heat once fully wilted. Season with salt and lemon juice. If the tomatoes weren't super ride it may need a small pinch of sugar to balance the flavors.

Top with fresh cilantro and optional reserved coconut milk. Serve with steamed basmati rice.

### notes
Good recipe to double. Could probably use a whole bin of spinach.  

The 14 oz crushed tomatoes could be replaced with diced tomatoes or even whole tomatoes that are broken down by hand, knife or blender.

By far, my favorite canned tomatoes are Bianco Dinapoli.
