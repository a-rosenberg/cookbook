### ingredients
- 3 eggs; steamed or boiled for 9 minutes  
- 1/4 - 1/2 Cup avocado oil mayonnaise  
- 1-2 Tbsp Dijon mustard  
- Old Bay seasoning  
- 1 handful spinach; rinsed and chopped  
- 3 slices lightly toasted bread  

### instructions
1. Mash eggs with a fork to desired consistency.  
2. In a bowl, combine mashed eggs, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and chopped spinach.  
3. Season generously with Old Bay until slightly salty, as it will also season the bread.  
4. Spoon and mash onto lightly toasted bread.  
5. Serve, ideally with fresh berries on the side.  

### notes
- Scales at 100%.  
- Avoid boiling more than 6 eggs at a time due to the temperature dip.  
- For best peeling, place eggs straight from the fridge into 1" of boiling water to steam and boil simultaneously. After cooking, transfer eggs directly into a bowl of ice water and let sit for at least 10 minutes.
