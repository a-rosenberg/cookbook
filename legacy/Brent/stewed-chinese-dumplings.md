### ingredients
- 1 bag frozen wontons, dumplings, gyoza, etc.
- 10-14 oz mushrooms; cut into bike sized pieces or long slabs
- 2 cups vegetable broth 
- 2-4 baby/shangai bok choy; fronds separated and washed
- 2 cloves garlic; minced
- 1” ginger; peeled and minced 
- 2 Tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 Tbsp rice vinegar 
- neutral oil for cooking
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil
- 2 green onion; sliced 
- 1-3 tsp chili crisp; depending on desired heat
- white sesame seeds; for garnish

### instructions
Heat large pan over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp of oil. Add mushrooms and cook, covered for a few minutes to steam through then uncover and finish browning. When cooked through, add garlic and ginger and cook for 1 minute while stirring frequently.

Add bag of frozen dumplings, 1-2 cups of the broth, and the oyster sauce. Stir to combine.  Lay bok choy over the top of the stew. Cook, covered again, for 5 minutes to steam the dumplings. 

Uncover, add rice vinegar and simmer until sauce is desired consistency. 

Take off heat and add sesame oil, chili crisp and green onion. Mix then top with sesame seeds.

### notes
My favorite is king trumpet mushrooms sliced into slabs. Can also use oyster, shitake, maitake, beech or crimini. Loved the Trader Joe’s shrimp gyoza. Typically end up using about 1.75 cup of broth.
