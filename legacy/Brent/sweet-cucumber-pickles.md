### ingredients
- 1/8" sliced cucumbers; enough to pack a mason jar (or tallboy mason jar)
- 1 cup hot tap water
- 1/2 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
- 5 Tbsp granulated sugar
- 2 1/4 tsp kosher salt

### instructions
1. Combine sugar, salt, vinegar and water in bowl and stir until dissolved.
2. Pour into mason jar until vegetables are fully covered or brine reaches the top.
3. Place in fridge.  Good after sitting overnight.  Will be fully 'ready' after 3-4 days.  Will keep for a month.

### notes
This is enough brine for a wide mouth tallboy mason jar.
