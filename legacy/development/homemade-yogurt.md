### ingredients
- 1/4 cup live culture yogurt (or previous homemade yogurt)
- 4 cups whole milk

### instructions
1. Add a thin layer of water to the bottom of a sauce pan to just barealy cover. Heat the milk uncovered 
until boiling bubbles just start to form, then immediately take off heat.
1. Allow to cool until the internal temperature is below 130F.
1. While the milk is cooling, smear 1 tsp of yogurt in the bottom of a 1 quart container. 
1. Once milk is cool, whisk in remaining 1/4 cup (minus 1 tsp) of yogurt. then pour into quart container. 
1. Place quart container in oven with light on for 2 1/2 hours.  We are waiting for the yogurt to 'set' which 
means it will be a semi-solid that jiggles like jello.  Check after the first 2 1/2 hours and then every hour after
until at jello consistency. Can take up to 6 hours.  
1. Once intially set, remove from oven and chillin fridge overnight to fully develop.
1. Good for 4-6 weeks.  Will start getting sour after 2 weeks, which is good or bad depending on your preferences. 

### notes
Our first attempt took about 5 hours to set.
