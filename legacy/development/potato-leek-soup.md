### ingredients
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 lb gold potatoes; sliced into 1/8-1/4" coins (or new potatoes, or yellow fingerling potatoes)
- 2 leeks; white and light green thinly sliced, green tops chopped
- 1-2 bunch lacinato kale; deribbed and chopped into bite sized pieces
- 4 green onion; sliced (a little reserved for a topping)
- 6 cups water
- 4 tsp better than bouillon vegetable base (a couple more for low sodium type)
- 1/4 cup sour cream (plus more for serving)
- sliced rustic bread
- salt and pepper
- white wine vinegar (possibly substitute with apple cider vinegar)

### instructions
1. Heat large pot over medium heat and add olive oil, potatoes and leeks.  Add with a pinch of salt and stir.  
Cook 5-8 minutes until the leeks start to break down and get glossy.  Add water and bouillon and bring to simmer.  
Cook for 30-45 minutes until potatoes are super tender and easily broken up with a wooden spoon.  
Break apart potatoes to thicken soup but leave enough chunks for texture.
1. Add green onion and kale and stir until greens are wilted wilted.  Fold in 1/4 cup of sour cream and cook for 1 minute more. Add 1 tsp vinegar.
1. Check seasoning and acid before ladeling into bowls and topping with another dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of green onion and some cracked black pepper. 

### notes
Modified from Alison Roman's PLS recipe.  She added lots of dill.  Maybe worth adding with kale and onion, but too aggressive as raw topping. Maybe a more tender bunch of dill would be better.
