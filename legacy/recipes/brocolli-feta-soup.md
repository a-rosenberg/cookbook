### ingredients
- 1 lb broccoli; rinsed and chopped (including the peeled stems)
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 2 cups water
- 3 cloves garlic; minced
- 1 small pinch red pepper flakes
- 5-10 cracks of black pepper
- 5 oz cup orzo pasta (approx 3/4 cup)
- 4 - 6 oz feta cheese; crumbled
- extra virgin olive oil for serving (optional)
- lemon juice for serving (optional)

### instructions
1. In a medium pot combine the broccoli, garlic, broth, water and peppers. Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover your pot and cook for 30 minutes.
1. Using a potato masher, gently smash the broccoli until reaching desired texture. Add the orzo and red pepper and cook uncovered, stirring frequently until pasta is cooked (about 10 minutes). The pasta will stick if left unattended for too long.
1. Remove the pot from heat and crumble in your feta. Mix it in. Add lemon juice if needed (didn’t because we had good acid in our feta) and season with salt if needed (ours had enough from the feta and broth). Drizzle with olive oil if desired (ours didn’t need it as well but is a nice flourish).
1. Serve with a crusty bread. 


### notes
Double it because it's better the next day.
