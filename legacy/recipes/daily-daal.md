### ingredients
- 8 oz red lentils (about 1 heaping cup)
- 2 Tbsp neutral cooking oil (e.g., avocado)
- 10 black peppercorns
- 5 cloves
- 1 onion; small dice
- 2.5" ginger; finely mined or grated
- 5 garlic cloves; peeled
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 scant tsp coriander 
- 1/2 tsp turmeric 
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 14oz can plum tomatoes
- cayenne pepper (optional)
- handful of cilantro; rinsed and roughly chopped (optional)
- one recipe basmati rice
- lemon (optional)


### instructions
1. Rinse red lentils until water runs clear.  Put in tall pot and cover with 2.5 cups cold water.  
Bring to a boil then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 10-15 minutes.
1. While lentils are cooking, heat the oil in a new pan over medium-low heat.  When hot, add peppercorns and 
cloves and cook until fragrant - about 30 seconds.  Add onions and cook while stirring often for 8-10 minutes 
or golden.  Add the ginger and crush in the garlic (I use a press) and cook for 2-3 minutes until fragrant but 
not burnt.  Tip in spices and salt and stir to coat.
1. Add can of tomatoes, crushing with your hands as they go in (granny style) or crush with wooden spoon in pan.  
Bring to a boil then simmer for 5 minutes. Cover and simmer 5 more.
1. Once the sauce has darkened and thickened a little bit start adding in the lentils with a slotted spoon.  
If it's too thick, thin with some of the lentil cooking liquid.  I found that mine typicaly doesn't need any 
additional liquid.
1. Simmer on low heat for 10 more minutes, uncovered if looking to thicken the sauce.  Taste and adjust seasoning.  
Add cayenne if it could use some spice.  Add lemon juice for acid if needed.
1. Serve with basmati rice or Jeff's naan and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro.


### Notes
Might want to remove cloves and peppercorns before serving if they're too powerful.
