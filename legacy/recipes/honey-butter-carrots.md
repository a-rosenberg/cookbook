### ingredients
- 2 lb medium carrots; a mix of colors is best - orange, purple, yellow and white
- 2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- Salt and pepper 
- 2 Tbsp honey 
- 2 Tbsp butter; cubed
- 2 Tbsp minced parsley

### instructions
1. Set oven to 425F. Thoroughly scrub the carrots leaving 1/2”-1” of the tops. Cut in half any significantly larger carrots so that they’re all similar, medium size. Pat or air dry.
1. Then lay on a parchment lined baking sheet in a single layer and cover with oil and season with salt and pepper then cook for 25 minutes until almost tender. 
1. Remove from oven, drizzle with honey then put it back in for 5 more minutes.  
1. Take out and toss the carrots with butter and parsley in a bowl or in the pan with the parchment removed. 

### notes
Can cut in half when cooking for 2... but you shouldn't because they reheat well as leftovers.
