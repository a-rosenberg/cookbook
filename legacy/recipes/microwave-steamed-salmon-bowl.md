### ingredients
- 8-10 oz salmon; something fatty - likely farmed
- 1 cup frozen spinach broken up small or tender asparagus cut into 1" segments
- 1 cup/210g short or medium grain rice (Kokuho); very well rinsed and drained
- 1 1/3 cup water (320g including rinsing residual)
- 1/2 heaping tsp hondashi
- 1 tsp soy sauce for rice
- 1/4 cup soy sauce for marinating 
- 2-3 green onion; thinly sliced on a bias
- (optional) sesame seeds
- (optional) chili crisp 

### instructions
1. Add drained rice, hondashi granules and soy sauce to large deep Anyday microwave dish. Cook for 10 minutes on power level 4, then 10 minutes on power level 3.
1. While cooking, slice salmon into 1/2‚Äù slabs and marinate in soy sauce. 1/4 cup might be too much so start with 2 tbsp first and add more as needed. Chinese light soy sauce worked well.
1. When rice is cooked, remove from microwave and without stirring cover evenly in frozen spinach or asparagus - breaking up any large chunks that would cook more slowly. Lay salmon over vegetables with a little bit of the marinade with each piece. Cook on full power (1200W is what we have) for 3:15. Maybe add 15-30 seconds to make fish and vegetables are cooked through. Top with green onion, and sesame seeds or chili crunch is using. 


### notes
While I use a microwave specific dish, should work with any microwave safe bowl and a top that will trap steam but can still vent enough to not explode.
