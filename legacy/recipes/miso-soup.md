### ingredients
- 6 cups water
- 1 Tbsp hondashi powder
- 1/4-1/2 cup shiro miso; approximate
- 1 green onion; thinly sliced across
- 1 Tbsp dried wakame

### instructions
1. Heat water in pot or in electric boiler for efficiency. Simmer in the pot and stir in the hondashi powder until fully dissolved - a few minutes.
1. Dip a whisk into the tub of miso and twist to pull up a few tablespoons of paste. Place a mesh strainer partially into the dashi broth and stir the 
paste until dissolved. The strainer should prevent any large grains in the miso from getting into the broth.
1. Turn off heat and and stir in green onion and wakame and wait 5 minutes for the wakame to bloom.
1. Serve while still hot.

### notes
Can add cubed soft tofu with green onion. I like it simpler, without tofu.
