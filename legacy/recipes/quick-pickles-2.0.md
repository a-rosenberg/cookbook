### ingredients
- 1 part white vinegar
- 1 part water
- 1 small pinch of salt per 2 cups brine
- sliced vegetables to pickle; e.g., red onion, radish, jalape√±o, daikon

### instructions
1. Combine the vinegar, water and salt in a small pot. Cover and bring to a simmer.
2. While the brine is coming up to heat, stuff a mason jar with the prepared vegetables.
3. Once simmering, pour brine onto vegetables until they're covered. Let sit out until cool enough to handle the jar then cover and place in fridge.

### notes
Should last at least a month. This is so much easier that I use this for almost everything.
