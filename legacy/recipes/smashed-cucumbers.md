### ingredients
- 2 seedless cucumbers; about 1 to 1 1/2 lbs; the english cucumbers work well here
- 1 tsp salt
- 2.5 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 3 tsp soy sauce
- 1.5 Tbsp rice vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic; finely chopped (optional)
- 1-2 tsp chili oil; I love momofuku chili crunch for this
- 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds

### instructions
1. Trim ends off of cucumber(s) and cut into 4-5" segments if long. Use the butt of a chef's knife to break the cucumber into pieces. It should result in 3-4 lengthwise sections.  Remove any pulp that was squished out and cut the segments on a bias in 1/4-1/2" slices.
1. Toss cucumbers with all other ingredients and let marinate for 10 minutes if possible.  If done ahead of time, keep in the fridge until 20-30 minutes before serving.
