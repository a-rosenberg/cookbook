### ingredients
- 3 rice cooker cups of white short or medium grain rice 
- 4 Tbsp rice vinegar 
- 3 Tbsp (scant) sugar 
- 1 tsp kosher salt 
- approx 2x2” kombu (optional)
- 4 Tbsp kewpie mayonnaise 
- 2 Tbsp sriracha or similar hot sauce
- 12-16 oz smoked slab salmon 
- avocado; sliced
- 1 cucumber thinly sliced and tossed with small amount of salt (optionally sugar), or 1 recipe of "smashed cucumbers" - below
- nori slices to make little sushi tacos
- pickled red onion, radish or jalapeño
- white and black toasted sesame seeds 
- broiled asparagus

### instructions
1. Start by cooking the rice in a rice cooker on the white or sushi setting. Make rice seasoning while it cooks by combining and stirring the rice vinegar, sugar and salt in a small mason jar. 
1. When the rice finishes cooking lay it out into a non-metallic broad bowl or even a glass tray and distribute the rice seasoning as evenly as possible. Carefully fold to combine. Fan with a sheet pan if possible to help cool the rice faster. 
1. If you're feeling lazy you can mix it into the rice cooker directly and leave it open to cool a bit.
1. Spicy mayo is just mixing together the mayonnaise and sriracha. With kewpie mayo it should be drizzle-able.
1. Break apart salmon and place on top of some rice, then add all the toppings you’d want.

### notes
Pretty much any vegetable works with this.  Sometimes I add seared mushrooms or tofu.  Fake crab works great too.
