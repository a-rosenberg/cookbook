### ingredients
- 1 package silken tofu drained (12 or 14 oz)
- 1/2 cup dark chocolate
- 1 pinch kosher salt
- 2 Tbsp maple syrup

### instructions
1. Blend everything really well - until the chocolate is no longer grainy. 
1. Put into storage and serving jars or bowl, then place in the fridge for a few hours. The flavor improves over time.

### notes
Toppings; e.g., mint, raspberries, sliced almonds, shaved chocolate.  I like storing and serving these in small mason 
jars.
