### ingredients
- 1-2 cups cooked short or medium grain white rice
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp shoyu
- 1 tsp mirin 
- 1 pinch salt 
- 1 smaller pinch MSG
- (optional) asparagus
- (optional) nori
- (optional) furikake
- (optional) diced kimchi

### instructions
1. Heat white rice until piping hot - 1.5 minutes in our microwave.
1. Make a small hole in the middle of the rice and crack in egg and top with the rest of the non-optional ingredients.
1. Whisk in with chopsticks and top with the optional stuff. 


### notes
If using leftover sushi rice just add a tiny bit of shoyu and MSG -- the mirin and pinch of salt would make it too sweet and salty.

If going for something really decadent, you can add a second egg yolk once mixed.

Could probably use a semi-brown haiga rice for this dish as well.
