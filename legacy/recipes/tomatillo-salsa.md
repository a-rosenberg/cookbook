### ingredients
- 8 tomatillos; paper wrappers and stems removed
- 1/4 white onion
- 1 jalapeño; stem removed and halved
- 1 clove garlic; skin on
- 1 handful cilantro 

### instructions
1. Heat oven to 450F. Add convection if it’s an option. 
1. Add washed tomatillos, onion, garlic clove and jalapeño to baking sheet (a 1/4 sheet fits everything well). Bake checking every few minutes and rotating to distribute browning (8-15 minutes total).
1. Once browned and maybe a little charred, remove and add to a blender - making sure to remove garlic peel. Add cilantro and a pinch of salt the pulse to desired consistency. Check seasoning.
1. Let it cool a little in the fridge before serving as the pectin from the tomatillos will cause it to thicken.

### notes
I love this in and on cheese and bean quesadillas - it cuts through the unctuousness perfectly.
