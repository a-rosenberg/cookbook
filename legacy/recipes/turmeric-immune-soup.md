### ingredients
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 4 carrots; small dice
- 4 celery stalks; small dice
- 2 smallish white, sweet or spanish onion; small dice
- 2-3 inches garlic; minced
- 6-8 garlic cloves; minced
- 3 tsp ground turmeric 
- 1/2 tsp red chili flakes
- 1 1/3 cup dried orzo
- 8 cups vegetable broth
- 2 Tbsp light miso
- 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1/4 cup parsley, flat or curly; chopped

### instructions
1. Heat a broad based pot over medium high heat.  Add olive oil, then onion, carrot and celery.  Cook until onion is 
very translucent, about 5-10 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, turmeric and chili flakes and cook until fragrant, about a 
minute.  Add broth and bring to boil. 
1. Once at a low boil, add orzo and cook stirring intermittently until almost al dente; 7-10 minutes.  In a small bowl, 
combine miso paste and vinegar.  Ladle in 2-3 Tbsp broth and stir until dissolved.  Add back into pot, then take off 
heat.
1. Check seasoning and add salt or pepper as needed. Stir in parsley and serve.  

### notes
Goes well with a crusty bread. Also stores well, but orzo will get plump and absorb 
lots of the broth.
