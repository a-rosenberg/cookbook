### ingredients
- 2 cups almond flour
- 1.5 cups old fashioned rolled oats
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1/2 tsp ground cloves
- 1/2 cup walnut chunks
- 2 Tbsp small chocolate chips (optional, to add to half)
- 1 can (14 oz) pumpkin puree
- 6 oz butter; melted
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 3 eggs

### instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
1. Whisk together the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients separately (larger bowl for the dry). Add the wet to the dry and mix until just combined.
1. Setup muffin tin with 12 cups and fill the batter to the brim.  If using chocolate chips, stop halfway through filling the cups and mix the chocolate into the batter until evenly distributed before finishing filling.
1. Once preheated, cook for 30-32 minutes.  Let cool in the tin for a minute or two until cool enough to handle then carefully remove and place on a cooling rack.  Once completely cooled (30-60 minutes), stored in a sealed container in the fridge.
1. When ready to eat, microwave for 20-30 seconds (depent on microwave, we have a weak one so use 30 seconds). 

### notes
The 3 Tbsp of spices (cinnamon, ginger, cloves) can be replaced with 3 Tbsp of pumpkin spice powder.  Or even easier, 3 Tbsp of cinnamon.  Any combination of autumnal spices will be fine.  I add a few chocolate chips to the top of the chococlate chip muffins before cooking as a flag.  A flaky sea salt before baking could also be nice.
