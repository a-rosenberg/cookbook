  "title": "asian avocado toast",
  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "2 slices rustic bread; e.g., prussian rye from whole foods",
    "1 ripe avocado; split in half and cut into large chunks",
    "1 Tbsp shoyu (or other type of soy sauce)",
    "1 tsp toasted sesame oil",
    "1 tsp rice vinegar",
    "1 tsp sriracha or chili crunch oil",
    "white and black toasted sesame seeds"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Darkly toast the bread, so it keeps its crunch.",
    "While toasting, with a spoon lightly stir together everything from avocado to rice vinegar - making sure not to mash the avocado yet.",
    "If using the sriracha also include this in the mixture.  If using chili crunch (like the momofuku chili crunch oil), then wait to top the toast at the end.",
    "Once the bread is toasted give it a minute outside the toaster to release some moisture. Tip the avocado mixture evenly onto the two pieces of bread then lightly mash in with a fork, creating fork marks for texture. Using the texture to hold them, top heavily with sesame seeds and the chili crunch if using.",
    "Check the season and sprinkle with finishing salt if needed."
  ],
  "notes": "If splitting between two people it's nice to cook a runny over-easy egg for each piece.",
