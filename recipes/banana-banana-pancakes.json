  "title": "banana banana pancakes",
  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 ripe bananas",
    "3 eggs",
    "Some sort of flour (I use almond)",
    "1 scant tsp baking powder",
    "salt (optional)",
    "coconut oil",
    "toppings; chocolate chips, blueberries (even frozen), peanut butter"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Smash bananas until they’re pudding. Mix in the eggs. Add flour until good pancake consistency (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup). Add baking powder and stir or whisk in. Add a pinch of salt if desired.",
    "Heat medium (~12”) pan over medium heat. Once hot add a bit of coconut oil and melt. Use a 1/4 cup scoop to add 3 pancakes to the pan, or use a tablespoon and make silver dollar pancakes.",
    "Cook a couple of minutes either side making sure they’re not burning.  Once they’re nicely browned remove the pancakes, add a bit more oil and start again - until batter is gone."
  ],
  "notes": "Frozen wild blueberries are the best topping."
