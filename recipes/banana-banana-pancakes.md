### ingredients
- 3 ripe bananas 
- 3 eggs 
- Some sort of flour (I use almond)
- 1 scant tsp baking powder
- Salt (optional)
- Toppings; chocolate chips, blueberries (even frozen), peanut butter
- Coconut oil 

### instructions
1. Smash bananas until they’re pudding. Mix in the eggs. Add flour until good pancake consistency (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup). Add baking powder and stir or whisk in. Add a pinch of salt if desired.
1. Heat medium (~12”) pan over medium heat. Once hot add a bit of coconut oil and melt. Use a 1/4 cup scoop to add 3 pancakes to the pan, or use a tablespoon and make silver dollar pancakes. 
1. Cook a couple minutes either side making sure they’re not burning.  Once they’re nicely browned remove the pancakes, add a bit more oil and start again - until batter is gone.
