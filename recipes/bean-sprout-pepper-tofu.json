  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 block super firm tofu; drained and cut into 1/2 inch slabs",
    "neutral oil",
    "2 Tbsp low sodium soy sauce",
    "2 oz garlic chives*; cut into 1 inch segments",
    "1 garlic clove; minced",
    "1 inch ginger; minced",
    "6-10 oz bean sprouts; rinsed and drained",
    "white pepper",
    "1 Tbsp sesame oil",
    "kosher or sea salt"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add a drizzle of oil. Place the tofu slabs in the pan, season well with salt, and cook until golden brown on one side, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until golden, another 3 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside. When cool enough to handle cut into strips.",
    "Clean out any extra tofu bits and oil from the pan. Add another splash of oil and bring up to medium heat. Add the garlic, ginger, sprouts and soy sauce and toss for 30 seconds. Add the chives, tofu strips and a few cracks of white pepper and season with sea salt.",
    "Cook until the sprouts are slightly wilted but still crunch - 1-3 minutes. Take the pan off heat and drizzle with sesame oil and toss to coat.",
    "Serve over white rice with extra white pepper as desired."
  ],
  "notes": "The original recipe by Hetty McKinnon called for extra firm tofu so that's probably good too. *Can likely substitute green onions for the chives.",
