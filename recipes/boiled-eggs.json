    "6 eggs"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Fill a small/medium pot with 1 - 1.5 \" water. Make sure to use a pot with a lid. Bring the water to a boil.",
    "Once at a full boil, carefully place the eggs in the pot to not crack them. I often use a pasta ladle or a spider for lowering carefully. The eggs should be partially out of the water. Cover the pot and cook for 9-11 minutes - see notes.",
    "While the eggs are cooking, prepare an ice bath. When your timer goes off, keep the heat on as you quickly move them to the ice bath to achieve the most heat shock possible.",
    "Once cooled in the bath for 10-20 minutes, carefully peel the eggs. You can use the water of the ice bath to help.",
    "Store covered in the fridge for a few days."
