  "title": "butternut spinach orzo risotto",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 cups butternut squash, peeled and cubed",
    "2-4 Tbsp olive oil",
    "1-2 tsp dried thyme (or extra thyme sprigs for garnish)",
    "salt and black pepper, to taste",
    "1 lb orzo pasta",
    "4 cups vegetable broth",
    "1 cup milk (or heavy cream for a thicker option)",
    "2 Tbsp olive oil (for cooking)",
    "4 garlic cloves, minced",
    "4 cups fresh spinach",
    "1 cup grated Parmesan cheese"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Preheat  oven to 425°F.",
    "Toss the cubed butternut squash with 4 Tbsp olive oil, dried thyme, salt, and pepper.",
    "Spread evenly on a baking sheet and roast for 20–25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until tender and caramelized.",
    "In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in the orzo and toast for 1–2 minutes.",
    "Pour in the 4 cups broth and bring to a simmer.",
    "Cook for 8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the orzo absorbs most of the liquid and is al dente.",
    "Reduce heat to low.",
    "Stir in the milk, grated Parmesan, and spinach. Cook for 2–3 minutes until the spinach wilts and the sauce is creamy.",
    "Adjust salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Gently fold in the roasted butternut squash. Serve warm, garnished with extra Parmesan and thyme sprigs if desired."
  ],
  "notes": "Don’t overcook the orzo: cook just until al dente to avoid a mushy texture. Make ahead -- roast the squash and prepare the creamy sauce in advance, then assemble and finish the dish before serving."
