### ingredients
- 1 can cannellini beans; drained and rinsed
- 3-4 tsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1 pinch red pepper flake 
- (optional) 1 light sprinkle msg
- 1 pinch salt 
- 1/2 lemon
- 2 Tbsp capers; roughly chopped 
- 2 large pieces of rustic bread; toasted 
- cracked pepper
- (optional) parsley; roughly chopped

### instructions
1. Add beans, olive oil and red pepper flakes to a medium pan over medium heat. Cook (confit) the beans for 5-10 minutes while stirring occasionally until most of the moisture is gone, making sure nothing is overcooked (i.e. dried out) or burned. 
1. Roughly mash with a wooden spoon and take off heat. Add 1/4 of a lemonâ€™s juice and taste, checking for acid and salt/msg. Put half on each slice of the well toasted bread and top with capers and some cracks of pepper. 
1. Serve with a couple deseeded lemon wedges, sprinkle with parsley if using. 

### notes
Goes well with a side of broiled asparagus.
