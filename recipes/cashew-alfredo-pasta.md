### ingredients
- 8 - 12 oz mushrooms; cut into thin cross-sections 
- 1 large handful asparagus or brocollini; tough stems removed and cut into 1‚Äù segments
- 8 oz medium pasta; I've used mezze rigatoni, penne and fusilli
- 1.5 cups cashew cream (approx 1 cup raw cashews and water to just less than covering in a high speed blender)
- 1 clove garlic 
- 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast 
- 1-2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- salt 
- pepper
- (optional) shredded parmesan cheese
- (optional) squeeze of lemon for serving

### instructions
Put salted water to boil. Add pasta and stir. 

Meanwhile, make cashew cream and blend in garlic clove and nutritional yeast. Process until smooth and season with salt aggressively. Add pasta water as needed to blend smoothly. 

In a large pan melt butter and cook asparagus until bright green (~2 minutes). Add mushrooms and 1/2 cup of pasta water and cover to steam for 2 minutes. Remove cover and stir to cook for another minute. Add cooked pasta and sauce and stir. There should be some mushroom infused water in the pan that will mix with and thin the sauce. 

Adjust seasoning and add 15 grinds of black pepper. Serve warm topped with parmesan cheese.

### notes
The goal is to have nearly the same amount of pasta and vegetables in every bite.
