### ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups raw cashews; soaked in water for 2 hours
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 3/4 Cup water
- salt to taste
- 1/4 Cup nutritional yeast
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 clove garlic
- 1/4 tsp turmeric
- pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)
- 1/2 tsp mustard; dijon or yellow
- 16 ounces Elbow or shell pasta of choice 
- black pepper to taste

### instructions
1. Prepare the pasta according to package directions. Drain the cashews if you soaked them (This makes them easier to blend).
1. While the pasta is cooking, combine the cashews, lemon juice, water, salt, nutritional yeast, chili powder, garlic, turmeric, 
cayenne (if using), and mustard in a high speed blender and blend until silky smooth. If the mixture is too thick, add 1-2 more 
tablespoons of water and blend again.
1. Once the pasta is tender, drain it, then return the pasta to the pot and stir in the cheese sauce. Season to taste with 
salt and pepper and serve warm.

### notes
Can blanch peas with this too for a more complete meal.
