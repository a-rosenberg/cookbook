  "ingredients": [
    "1 cup all-purpose flour",
    "1 cup whole wheat flour",
    "1 tsp salt",
    "2 Tbsp oil; I used olive with no negative effects",
    "3/4-1 cup hot water",
    "A little more 1:1 flour mixture for rolling"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Mix together the dry ingredients then pour in oil. Break up oil between fingers until small, and breadcrumb like. Bring together with water then knead until soft and smooth. Should be elastic but not sticky - add water as needed.",
    "Bring a cast iron pan up to heat over medium/medium-high.",
    "Break the dough into 8–12 pieces depending on desired size. Cover with a damp but well wrung out clean dish towel if not immediately making. Roll pieces into a ball then dip into extra rolling flour. Roll out to 2/3 final size then flour lightly again and roll to final size (5–8” diameter). Shake off excess flour then cook on very hot pan. Should only be about 30 seconds a side so they don’t dry out."
