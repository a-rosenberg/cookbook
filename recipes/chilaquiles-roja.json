  "title": "chilaquiles roja",
  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "5 roma tomatoes; split in half, longways",
    "1/2 white onion; cut in half into two large quarters",
    "1 jalape√±o; split in half",
    "2 garlic cloves, peel on",
    "2 dried chiles de arbol (optional); tops trimmed, deseeded and covered and rehydrated in boiling water for 10 minutes",
    "salt",
    "avocado oil (or other neutral oil)",
    "4 cups tortilla chips (or whatever amount feels right -- I normally grab about four handfuls)",
    "1/2-1 cup vegetable broth",
    "feta cheese",
    "fresh group pepper",
    "2 eggs",
    "few sprigs of cilantro; roughly chopped"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "You can make the salsa roja ahead of time.  Preheat the broiler. Add a tiny bit of oil to a baking sheet -- I find these fit perfectly on the smaller quarter sheet. Add",
    "When ready to cook, preheat a small pan for eggs on medium low and a larger pan on medium high for the tortillas.",
    "Cook the eggs slowly, in a bit of oil, sunny side up or over easy.",
    "While eggs are cooking, add Tbsp of oil to the large pan then add 1 cup of the salsa roja and simmer for a few minutes on its own to develop flavor.  Add broth and bring back up to a simmer",
    "Plate the chilaquiles and add the egg, crumbled feta, chopped parsley and a crack of fresh black pepper.  Serve immediately before it gets soggy."
  ],
  "notes": "Meal for two. Based on an Ethan Cheblowski recipe. The salsa is relatively hot, especially if you use the chiles de arbol."
