### ingredients
- 5 roma tomatoes; split in half, longways
- 1/2 white onion; cut in half into two large quarters 
- 1 jalapeño; split in half
- 2 garlic cloves, peel on
- 2 dried chiles de arbol (optional); tops trimmed, deseeded and covered and rehydrated in boiling water for 10 minutes
- salt


- avocado oil (or other neutral oil)
- 4 cups tortilla chips (or whatever amountfeels right)
- 1 cup vegetable broth 
- feta cheese
- fresh group pepper
- 2 eggs
- few sprigs of cilantro; roughly chopped


### instructions
1. You can make the salsa roja ahead of time.  Preheat the broiler. Add a tiny bit of oil to a baking sheet -- I find these fit perfectly on the smaller quarter sheet. Add 
all vegetables cut side down and toss on the garlic, making sure the bottoms are all covered in oil as not to stick.  Place in oven and watch carefully.  You want
the tomatoes to brown deeply and split but not blacken.  Maybe 5 minutes later, before things are black, remove from the oven and let cool for a couple minutes until 
they can be safely handled.  Remove the skin of the tomatoes and the outside layer of the onion if it was accidentally blackened.  Peel the garlic and trim the stem off the
jalapeño.  Place all the vegtables in a food processor (including the chiles de arbol, if using). Process until smooth but not a comletely smooth like a puree.  Texture 
here might be a bit of preference.  Check seasoning.  Place in jar and store in the fridge if not using immediately.  
1. When ready to cook, preheat a small pan for eggs on medium low and a larger pan on medium high for the tortillas.  
1. Cook the eggs slowly, in a bit of oil, sunny side up or over easy.
1. Add Tbsp of oil to the large pan then add 1.5 cups of the salsa roja and simmer for a few minutes on its own to develop flavor.  Add broth and bring back up to a simmer
for a few minutes until you have the desired consistency.  Then turn off the heat and toss the tortillas in the sauce until coated. 
1. Plate the chilaquiles and add the egg, crumbled feta, chopped parsley and a crack of fresh black pepper.  Serve immediately before it gets soggy.

### notes
Based on an Ethan Cheblowski recipe.  The salsa is relatively hot, especially if you use the chiles de arbol.
