### ingredients
- 2.5 cups dry short grain brown rice
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 lime
- 1/2 cup cilantro; chopped
- 1 pinch salt
- 1-2 Tbsp neutral oil
- tortillas, large, about 10"
- 2 sweet potatoes; small to medium dice
- 2 cans black beans with liquid 
- 2 garlic cloves; lightly crushed
- 3 springs cilantro; whole
- shredded cheese (pepper-jack is nice)
- red salsa
- hot sauce (optional)
- nutritional yeast (optional) 

### instructions
1. Cook short grain rice in rice cooker with bay leaves and correct amount of water.  Once finished, remove leaves, add juice of 1/2 lime, cilantro, salt and neutral oil.  Taste the rice and adjust as necessary.
2. Combine whole cans of beans, crushed garlic and cilantro springs in a pot over medium low heat.  Simmer for 30 minutes until super tender then crush some (maybe 1/4) of the beans against the side of the pot to release starch.  Stir well.
3. Preheat oven to 400F. Toss sweet potatoes in neutral oil and a pinch of salt and lay on a parchment lined baking sheet.  Roast for 12 minutes then flip and roast another 12, checking a couple times during cooking to prevent any burning.
4.  Heat tortilla until it is supple and almost too hot to handle.  Lay on a plate and pile on the rice, then beans, then sweet potato.  Top with salsa and cheese.  Burrito roll it and serve hot. 

### notes
If not serving immediately, keep the main ingredients in the fridge and assemble each burrito when ready for cooking.
