### ingredients
- 2 cup jasmine rice; throoughly rinsed
- 1 14 oz can of coconut milk
- 1.5 cup water
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 Tbsp shredded coconut; plus more, toasted for a garnish if desired

### instructions
1. Combine in a rice cooker and stir as much as possible.
2. Cook on sweet setting, or just the white setting if a simple cooker.
3. Fluff and stir to combine the shredded coconut which will have floated to the top.

### notes
High quality coconut milk makes a massive difference.  I really like Thai Kitchen brand, and dislike Trader Joes.
