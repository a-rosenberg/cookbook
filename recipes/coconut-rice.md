### ingredients
- 2 cup jasmine rice; thoroughly rinsed
- 1 14 oz can of coconut milk
- 1.5 cup water
- 1 tsp salt
- 3 Tbsp shredded coconut; plus more, toasted for a garnish if desired

### instructions
1. Combine in a rice cooker and stir.
2. Cook on sweet setting, or just the white setting if sweet is not an option.
3. Fluff and stir to combine the shredded coconut which will have floated to the top.

### notes
High quality coconut milk makes a massive difference.  I really like Thai Kitchen brand, and dislike Trader Joes.
