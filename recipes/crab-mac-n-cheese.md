### ingredients
- 1 lb pasta (I like cavatappi)
- 2 tbsp butter + a little more for greasing baking dish
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
- 2 cups whole milk
- 10 oz sharp cheddar; shredded
- 2-4 oz gruyere/asiago; shredded (optional)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1/8 tsp rep pepper (optional)
- 1/2 - 1 lb crab meat; drained (lump or claw, optional)

### instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400F and grease a dutch oven or baking dish.  Heat 2 cups of milk in microwave for 1.5 minutes.
2. In a broad pan or dutch oven melt 2 Tbsp butter over medium low heat.  Add flour 
while continually stirring until smooth.  Continue stirring for while cooking for 1 minute.
3. Slowly add milk while whisking.  If the mixture clumps up keep on stirring and adding milk until smooth.  Once smooth, 
cook for 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens.  Add salt, black pepper and red pepper (if using).
4. Remove from heat and add 2/3 shredded cheese.  Stir until a smooth cheese sauce forms.  Add drained crab (if using) and pasta and 
stir.  Taste for seasoning and salt as necessary.
5. When seasoning is right, turn into the baking dish and cover with remaining cheese.  Bake for 10-20 minutes until bubbly and
ligtly browned.  Let sit to cool for 5 minutes then serve.

### notes
Other pastas that would work besides cavatappi: campanelle, macaroni, elbows, shells, fusilli (a la Boston Market), mezzi 
rigatoni, or penne.  While claw meat looks good with the red highlights, I think the lump crab meat tasted better and had less shell bits.
