### ingredients
- 1.5 lb eggplant
- 1/2 cup lentils; rinsed
- scant 1/4 cup pomegranate molasses
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 yellow onion; fine dice
- 2 anaheim peppers; diced
- 2 tomatoes; diced
- 4 garlic cloves; minced
- 1 Tbsp tomato paste
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- small handful mint leaves; chopped with a few reserved
- pomegranate seeds (optional)
- goat or greek yogurt (optional)

### instructions
1. Partially peel the eggplant so it has lengthwise stripes, then cut it lengthwise into 4 slices. Score each slice 
on 1 side in a crosshatch pattern. Cut each slice crosswise into 3 pieces and set on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle
with salt. Let stand for 1 hour.
2. In a small saucepan, cover the lentils with 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to moderate 
and simmer until tender, 15-30 minutes depending on type of lentil. Drain and put aside.
3. In a bowl, toss the onion with the garlic, tomatoes, green chiles, 2 Tbsp mint (leaving a few leaves for garnish), 
tomato paste, crushed red pepper and 2 teaspoons of salt.
4. Coat a small enameled cast-iron Dutch oven or casserole dish with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil.  Layer pot with 
eggplant slices, vegetables, and lentils: Rinse the eggplant and pat dry. Spread 1/2 of the vegetable mixture in the 
Dutch oven and top with half of the eggplant. Cover with half of the lentils and half of the remaining vegetable mixture. 
Top with the remaining eggplant, lentils and vegetables. Pour the remaining olive oil around the side and over the 
vegetables, then drizzle with the pomegranate molasses.
5. Heat the stew over medium until the liquid in the stew is simmering. Cover and cook over medium-low heat until the 
eggplant is very tender, about 1 1/2 hours.
6. Serve over basmati rice (see notes), garnish with mint and the optional yogurt and pomegranate seeds.
