### ingredients
- 1 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/2 ounces parmesan cheese; grated
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg; microplaned fresh is preferred
- 1/2 cup peas
- 1 bunch asparagus; trimmed
- 2 or 3 portabello mushrooms; rinsed and gills cleaned out
- 1 recipe of [homemade food processor pasta](https://github.com/a-rosenberg/cookbook/blob/master/recipes/food-processor-pasta.md) or 1 package of storebought fresh egg fettucine noodles

### instructions
1. If using homemade dough, roll out dough and cut into fettucine width noddles.  Rest while preparing sauce.
2. Bring 1 cup of the heavy cream to a simmer and cook until reduced to about 2/3 cup; 12-15 minutes.  
Remove from heat and add 1/2 tsp salt and a few grinds of fresh pepper.
3. While cream is simmering, heat 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. When hot add mushrooms and asparagus and cook until tender.  Add peas and cook through. Set aside to add later. 
4. Meanwhile, return the cream mixture to a simmer and bring salted water to boil. Add cheese and nutmeg to cream mixture and cook the pasta. Add the fettucine directly from the boiling water to the sauce and mix until the cheese has melted.  Add the vegetables and stir until everything is familiar.
5. Add reserved water to adjust consistency knowing that the sauce will thicken some as it cools.  Serve immediately with a warm baguette. 

### notes
Because of the decadence of this dish I like to serve a light, acidic salad before the meal - spring mix, herbs, thin sliced red onion, carrot, cherry tomato, crouton and a nice vinaigrette.
