### ingredients
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 tbsp olive oil

### instructions
1. Pulse salt and flour in a food processor. 
2. Add eggs and olive oil to bowl and process for 30-60 seconds.  The contents should come together into a large ball.  
If the dough isn't coming coming together add water 1 tbsp at a time and process again for 15 seconds.
3. Once you have a ball, plop the dough onto a cutting board and knead until the ball is relatively smooth and soft.
4. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.  Once rested it is ready to be rolled into whatever style pasta you'd like

### notes
For a more decandent pasta, replace one whole egg with two yolks.
