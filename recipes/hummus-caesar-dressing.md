### ingredients
- 1/2 cup hummus
- 1 tsp spicy whole grain mustard
- 1/2 tsp lemon zest (1 lemon's worth)
- 1 Tbsp capers; finely minced
- 1 heaping Tbsp caper brine
- 3 Tbsp garlic; minced (4-5 small cloves cloves)
- 1 pinch salt
- couple cracks of ground pepper
- 1-2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp maple syrup 
- (optional) water; to thin sauce
- (optional) lemon juice; to taste as needed


### instructions
1. Stir everything together.
2. Thin slightly with water to get desired consistency.
3. Add lemon juice as needed.  I find this typically isn't necessary with good caper brine.
4. Can be served right away but does well with a sit for the flavors to mingle -- maybe 30 minutes. 

### notes
Really good massaged into crunchy greens; e.g., romaine hearts, lacinato kale.
