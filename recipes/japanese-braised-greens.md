#### ingredients
- 2 tbsp neutral oil
- 3 cloves garlic; smashed then thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp miso paste- light or medium
- 1 tsp rice vinegar

#### instructions
1. Cook stems in oil over medium low heat until the stems are starting to cook but still firm. 
2. Add garlic and simmer while stirring for another minute. Add chard leaves and stir while cooking until begins to release water. 
3. Add miso paste and rice vinegar and stir to evenly combine into the chard water. If it's too dry add a couple tablespoons. Cook until most water evaporates and the chard is in a sticky sauce. 
3. Season to taste and serve. 

#### notes
Chard is easily replaced with lacinato kale. Cut out and discard stem & cook leaves in oil over medium low heat. The rest of the directions remain the same.
