### ingredients
- 2 tsp dry active yeast
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 1/2 - 3 cups all-purpose flour, divided
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/3 cup plain yogurt (greek works as well)
- 1 large egg

### instructions
1. In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar and water. Stir to dissolve then let sit for a few minutes or until it is
frothy on top. Once frothy, whisk in the oil, yogurt, and egg until evenly combined.
1. In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 cup of the flour with the salt. Next, pour the bowl of wet ingredients
to the flour/salt mixture and stir until well combined. Continue adding flour, a half cup at a time, until you can
no longer stir it with a spoon (about 1 to 1.5 cups later).  I find this is almost always 2.5 cups of flour total
when using king arthur all-purpose flour.
1. At that point, turn the ball of dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead the ball of dough for about
3 minutes, adding small amounts of flour as necessary to keep the dough from sticking. You'll end up using between
2.5 to 3 cups flour total. The dough should be smooth and very soft but not sticky. Avoid adding excessive amounts
of flour as you knead, as this can make the dough too dry and stiff.
1. Loosely cover the dough and let it rise until double in size (about 1 hour). After it rises, gently flatten the
dough into a disc and cut it into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a small ball.
1. Heat a large, heavy bottomed skillet over medium heat (I prefer cast iron for this). Working with one ball at a time,
roll it out until it is about 1/4 inch thick or approximately 6 inches in diameter. Place the rolled out dough onto
the hot skillet and cook until the bottom is golden brown and large bubbles have formed on the surface. Flip the dough
and cook the other side until golden brown as well. Stack the cooked flat bread on a plate and cover with a towel to
keep warm as you cook the remaining pieces. Serve plain or brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with

### notes
This is pretty much just the budget bytes homemade naan recipe. These keep well stored in mason jars then reheated on
a hot pan like they were cooked.
