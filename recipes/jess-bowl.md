- 2 large sweet potatoes; 3/4" dice
- 2 delicata squash; cut into half moons

### instructions
1. Place rice in a rice cooker or on the stove. Cook according to package directions.
2. Peel sweet potatoes and cut into 3/4" cubes. Cut off top of delicata squash, slice length-wise, scoop out inards, and slice into 1/2" wide half moons.
3. While potatoes & squash are cooking, heat a pan to low medium heat. Add 2 tbsp neutral oil and crimini mushrooms. Cook until tender. While mushrooms are cooking, prepare japanese braised greens. Jess prefers using lacinato kale. Add cooked mushrooms to the pan of greens and cook on low for another minute. Remove from heat and set aside.
4. Prepare bowls. Before adding vegetables, mix a dash of toasted sesame oil into the cooked rice. Pile on vegetables and top with a fried egg (optional). Add tamari/soy sauce and siracha to taste.
