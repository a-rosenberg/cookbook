### ingredients
- 1 cup dry quinoa (about 3 cups cooked)
- 1 3/4 cup water (or vegetable broth)
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp olive oil or butter
- 1 cucumber; small dice
- 1 red pepper; small dice
- 1 small red onion; small dice (maybe 1/2 or 3/4 of a giant one)
- 1 can chickpeas; rinsed and drained
- 1 bunch of parsley, finely chopped 
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup lemon juice (2 or 3 lemons)
- 1 Tbsp sherry vinegar (red wine vinegar could work too)
- 2 garlic cloves; pressed
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt

### instructions
1. Cook the quinoa. Thoroughly rinse quinoa while heating oil in medium-sized pot over medium heat.  When the quinoa 
are washed and the pan is hot, add drained quinoa and cook stirring to toast as the remaining water evaporates - about 2-3 
minutes. Stir in water and salt and bring to a rolling boil.  Reduce heat to the lowest setting and cover the pot.  
Cook for 15 minutes without removing the top, then take off heat and let sit, unopened, for 5 more minutes.  
Fluff with a fork and allow to cool some. 
1. While quinoa cooks, prep and combine the ingredients from cucumber to parsley in a large mixing bowl.
1. Make the dressing. Combine ingredients from olive oil to kosher salt in a mason jar.  Put on the lid and give it a good shake.
1. Once the quinoa has cooled a bit as to not cook the veggies, add to the mixing bowl and stir to mix.  Shake the dressing again and pour 
over the mixture while stirring.  It's good now a little warm, and will be good cold out of the fridge for another few days.

### notes
I like the sherry vinegar a lot more than red wine in this application.  As I was making 
it I thought it would need something like feta, but once I tasted it I really don't think that's the case.  Dressing might benefit from 
a pinch of red pepper flakes.  A good camping recipe due to the short cook and cold presentation.
