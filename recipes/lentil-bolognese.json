  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 Tbsp olive oil",
    "2-3 carrots; small dice",
    "1-2 celery stalks; small dice",
    "1 onion; small dice",
    "1 cup beluga (black) lentils",
    "4 cups vegetable broth",
    "2 Tbsp unsalted butter",
    "1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar",
    "pasta, dried or homemade; cooked"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Cook veggies in base of the pressure cooker on \"saut√©\" mode with the top off.  Stir often so the vegetables don't burn, until lightly browned and soft.",
    "Add lentils and 2.5 cups of the hot broth to the pressure cooker.  Cover and set to 15 minutes on high pressure. Manually release pressure with a rag over the steam output.",
    "Remove and blend half the sauce then put back into the pot.  Stir in butter and balsamic and season to taste."
  ],
  "notes": "A thick balsamic works best here - look for ~ density 1.30. For boxed pasta I prefer *De Cecco* brand and a shape without holes or tubes for the sauce to get stuck in. Good options are farfalle, oriechette or fettuccine. Also goes really well over roasted spaghetti squash.",
