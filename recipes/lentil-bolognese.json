  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 Tbsp olive oil",
    "2-3 carrots; small dice",
    "1-2 celery stalks; small dice",
    "1 onion; small dice",
    "1 cup beluga (black) lentils",
    "4 cups vegetable broth",
    "2 Tbsp unsalted butter",
    "1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar",
    "pasta, dried or homemade; cooked"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oil over medium-low heat then add carrots.  Cook for a couple minutes then add onions and celery and cook",
    "Rinse lentils then add to the pot.  Toss around then add the 4 cups of broth.  Bring to a boil over high heat then",
    "Remove half the sauce to a blender or food processor and blitz to a rough paste or smooth depending on preference.  Add this back to the pot along with",
    "Serve over noodles with a few cracks of fresh pepper and some chopped parsley or parmesan.",
    "Cook veggies in base of the pressure cooker on \"saut√©\" mode with the top off.  Stir often so the vegetables don't burn, until browned and soft.",
    "Add lentils and 2.5 cups of the hot broth to the pressure cooker.  Cover and set to 15 minutes on high pressure. Manually release pressure with a rag over the steam output.",

  ],
  "notes": "A thick balsamic works best here - look for ~ density 1.30. For boxed pasta I prefer *De Cecco* brand and a shape without holes or tubes for the sauce to get stuck in. Good options are farfalle, oriechette or fettuccine. Also goes really well over roasted spaghetti squash."
