### ingredients
- 3 tbsp olive oil (not extra virgin)
- 2 carrots; small dice
- 1 onion; small dice
- 1 cup puy lentils
- 4 cups vegetable broth
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 scant tbsp balsamic vinegar
- 1 8-10 ounce package fettucine noodles or 1 recipe of [homemade pasta dough]()

### instructions
1. Heat the oil over medium-low heat then add carrots.  Cook for a couple minutes then add onions and cook until golden; about 10-15 minutes.
2. Rinse lentils then add to the pot.  Toss around then add the 4 cups of broth.  Bring to a boil over high heat then reduce to a simmer and 
allow to cook for 35-45 minutes until the lentils have absorbed much of the water and are abundantly tender.  This is a good time to check the seasoning.
3. Remove half the sauce to a blender or food processer and blitz to a rough paste.  Add this back to the pot along with butter and the balmasic vinegar.
4. Serve over noodles with a few cracks of fresh pepper and some chopped parsley.

### notes
Can use any type of broth.  Mushroom or chicken broth would be nice.
