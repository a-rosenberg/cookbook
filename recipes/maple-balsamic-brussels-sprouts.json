  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1 lb brussels sprouts; bottoms trimmed and quartered",
    "1 can chickpeas; drained and rinsed",
    "2 Tbsp olive oil; maybe more",
    "2 Tbsp maple syrup",
    "1-2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar",
    "salt and pepper to taste"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Heat a broad pan over medium heat.",
    "Add olive oil, then add Brussels sprouts with salt and pepper. Stir only occasionally to allow browning to develop.",
    "Once tender throughout, add maple syrup and balsamic vinegar. Toss for a minute or two then add the chickpeas.",
    "Stir almost continuously to prevent burning and cook until sprouts are well coated and the sauce thickens."
  ],
  "notes": "I like a thicker, aged balsamic vinegar for this recipe (density 1.3+). Goes well mixed into half a bag of cooked-in-broth harvest grains blend from TJs."
