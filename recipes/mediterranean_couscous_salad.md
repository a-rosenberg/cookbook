### ingredients
- 1.5 cup whole wheat couscous
- 1 english cucumber; small dice
- 1 small carton good cherry tomatoes; cut in half
- 1 red pepper; small dice (optional, as a replacement for tomatoes)
- 1 can garbanzo beans; drained
- 1/4 cup (or more) italian dressing
- 1 avocado (optional as topping)
- salt

### instructions
1. Boil 1.5 cups of water with a pinch of salt in a small saucepan.  Once it's boiling, add couscous and stir, take 
off heat and let rest for 5+ minutes with the lid on before fluffing with a fork.
1. Combine veggies and dressing to let marinate while couscous steams. 
1. Top couscous with veggie salad.  Top that with optional sliced avocados.  Add more dressing if necessary.

### notes
If really getting fancy, could add chopped parsley. If using persian cucumbers prep 2-3 instead of 1. For chickpeas, 
I prefer *Goya* brand.
