  "title": "microwave mug brownie",
  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 Tbsp all purpose flour",
    "2 Tbsp granulated sugar",
    "1 small pinch salt",
    "1.5 Tbsp cocoa powder",
    "1-2 Tbsp chocolate chips",
    "1/4 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1.5 oil or melted butter; avocado oil is best",
    "3 Tbsp almond milk"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Combine in mug in order above and stir until no dry patches. Can stir dry ingredients before adding the wet.",
    "Cook uncovered in microwave for 1:15 at full power (~1200W). Do not open microwave when it finishes and allow it to steam for 2 minutes after. This helps reduce the souffl√©-like collapse.",
    "Serve with cold almond milk or a scoop of ice cream on top."
  ],
  "notes": "May have to adjust for different power microwaves - this timing is good for 1200W. Also, make sure to not cover the mug - the steam is bad for the texture."
