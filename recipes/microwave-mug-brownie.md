### ingredients
- 3 Tbsp all purpose flour
- 2 Tbsp granulated sugar
- 1 small pinch salt
- 1.5 Tbsp cocoa powder
- 1-2 Tbsp chocolate chips
- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
- 1.5 oil or melted butter; avocado oil is best
- 3 Tbsp almond milk

### instructions
Combine in mug in order above and stir until no dry patches. Can stir dry ingredients before adding the wet. 

Cook uncovered in microwave for 1:15 at full power (~1200W). Do not open microwave when it finishes and allow it to steam for 2 minutes after. This helps reduce the souffl√©-like collapse. 

Serve with cold almond milk or a scoop of ice cream on top. 


### notes
May have to adjust for different power microwaves - this timing is good for 1200W.

Also, make sure to not cover the mug - the steam is bad for the texture.
