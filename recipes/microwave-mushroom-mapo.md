### ingredients
- 150-200 g shiitake mushrooms; diced  
- (optional) 1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns; ground  
- 2 Tbsp ginger; finely chopped  
- 4 cloves garlic; finely chopped  
- 2 Tbsp vegetable oil  
- 4 tsp fermented black beans (douchi)  
- 4 tsp Sichuan chili bean paste (doubanjiang)  
- 1⅓ Cups (320ml) vegetable stock or water  
- 4 tsp soy sauce  
- 14 oz (400g) firm tofu; diced medium  
- 4 tsp cornstarch  
- ½ tsp sesame oil  
- Scallions, thinly sliced (optional)  

### instructions
1. In a microwave-safe dish, combine diced shiitake mushrooms, ground Sichuan peppercorns, finely chopped ginger and garlic, vegetable oil, fermented black beans, and Sichuan chili bean paste. Stir to mix.  
2. Cover the dish with a microwave-safe lid or microwave-safe plastic wrap, leaving a small vent for steam to escape. Microwave on high for 2–3 minutes, or until fragrant.  
3. Add vegetable stock and soy sauce to the mixture; stir to combine. Gently add diced silken tofu to the sauce. Cover and microwave on high for 6–8 minutes, or until the tofu is heated through.  
4. In a separate small bowl, mix 4 tsp of cornstarch with 2 Tbsp of water to create a slurry. Add the slurry to the dish, stirring gently to avoid breaking the tofu. Cover and microwave on high for an additional 2–3 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.  
5. Drizzle with sesame oil and garnish with thinly sliced scallions, if desired. Serve hot over steamed rice.  

### notes
- Adjust the level of spiciness by varying the amount of Sichuan chili bean paste.  
- For a more intense flavor, allow the dish to sit for a few minutes before serving to let the flavors meld.  
- Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and reheated in the microwave.
