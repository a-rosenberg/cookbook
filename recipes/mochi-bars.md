### ingredients
- 1/2 cup mochi flour  
- 1/2 cup water or almond milk  
- 2 Tbsp butter, sliced  
- 2 Tbsp maple syrup  
- 2 cups puffed brown rice (aka brown rice crisps)  
- (optional) 1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut  
- Pinch of salt  

### instructions
1. Mix together mochi flour, liquid, butter, salt, and maple syrup in a large microwave-safe bowl. Use a large bowl to allow room for mixing in the rice and coconut later.  
2. Microwave the mixture covered on high (1200W) for 1 minute. Stir to finish melting the butter.  
3. Cook again for 2 minutes on high.  
4. Mix in the puffed brown rice and optional shredded coconut until evenly combined.  
5. Transfer the mixture to a buttered sheet pan or plain parchment paper. Shape into a rectangle for easy cutting. A 1/4 sheet pan works well.  
6. Let cool, then cut into bars as desired.  

### notes
- For portability, wrap bars in parchment paper and place them in a reusable bag like a Stasher bag.  
- Great for taking on rides or as a quick snack.
