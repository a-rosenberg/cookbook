### ingredients
- 1/3 cup olive oil
- 4 yellow onions; thinly sliced
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp sweet paprika
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 3-5 cups spinach; chopped small
- 3 tsp sherry vinegar
- 3 cup french green lentils (e.g., puy) cooked; 1 cup dry; seasoned with salt after cooking
- 3 cup short grained brown rice cooked; 2 cup dry
- 1/2 cup of yogurt (optional); I prefer plain goat yogurt for this

### instructions
1. Heat a wide, large skillet or pot over medium-high.  Add olive oil and allow to heat for a bit before adding onions and salt.
Cook for 20-30 minutes until the onions are broken down and browned.  If the browned bits in the pot start verging on burnt, deglaze the
pan with a bit of water.
2. Add spices and toast for 30 seconds.  Add the spinach and cook until wilted; about 3 minutes. Fold in the lentils and brown rice and
heat through.  Taste for seasoning.  I found it needed a couple more pinches. 
3. Serve warm with a dollop of yogurt (I prefer plain goat yogurt) with a crack of pepper.

### notes
Make sure to use proper [french lentils](https://www.bobsredmill.com/petite-french-green-lentils.html) and not just "green lentils" as they cook completely differently -- frencg green won't turn to mush!
A simple way to cook green lentils: add 1 cup of lentils and 3 cups of cold water to a medium sized pot.  Bring to a boil then drop to low 
and simmer for 25 minutes.  If the lentils are tender, strain and set aside.
