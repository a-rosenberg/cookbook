### ingredients
- 1 cup split yellow mung beans
- 2.5 cups of water; separated
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1 cup bean sprouts
- 1 cup roughly chopped kimchi
- 4 green onions; chopped
- 2 Tbsp fish sauce
- (optional) 2 Tbsp korean chili flakes; i.e., gochugaru
- 1 Tbsp chopped garlic
- neutral oil for frying

### instructions
1. Place the beans and 2 cups of the water in a medium bowl and 
soak for 1 hour. They should increase in volume by about 50 percent.
1. Drain the beans, then place in a blender. Add the remaining 1/2 cup 
water. Blend on high speed until the mixture is very smooth, 15 to 30 seconds. 
1. Season before cooking. The batter can be made ahead but do not add salt until ready to cook.
1. Blanch bean sprouts in a small saucepan of boiling water for 15-30 seconds
1. Add everything together in a large mixing bowl and begin heating an 8" pan. Once hot add 1 Tbsp neutral oil and turn to coat the bottom. Add 3/4 cup of the mixture and spread into a 6-7" pancake.
1. Cook, undisturbed, for about 2 minutes or until you can see the bottom edges beginning to brown.  Loosen the edges with a spatula and turn. Add another Tbsp of oil if needed and cook another 2-3 minutes.
1. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate or rack and continue cooking until the batter is gone. Serve as soon as possible. 

### notes
You can make this mixture and refrigerate, covered, for up to 3 days.
