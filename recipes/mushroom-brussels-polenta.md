### ingredients
- 1 lb mushrooms, crimini are fine  
- 5 cloves garlic, minced  
- Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)  
- Salt and pepper  
- 2 Tbsp butter  
- 20 medium Brussels sprouts, thinly sliced  
- 1/2 large onion (or 3/4 small), thinly sliced (preferably red or sweet yellow)  

#### polenta  
- 4 Cups water  
- 1 Cup dried polenta  
- 4 Tbsp butter  
- 1/2–1 Cup grated Parmesan  

### instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375°F.  
2. Trim and slice mushrooms in half. Toss in olive oil, salt, pepper, and minced garlic directly on a baking sheet (should just fit into a 1/4 baking sheet).  
3. Bake for 20 minutes.  
4. Bring water to a boil and add polenta. Reduce to a low simmer and cook for 15 minutes, stirring often.  
5. Add 4 Tbsp butter and Parmesan, then season to taste with salt.  
6. Meanwhile, cook the Brussels sprouts and onion in 2 Tbsp butter until deeply browned. Season to taste.  
7. To serve, spread polenta onto a plate, tapping it to fill the bottom like risotto.  
8. Top with a nest of Brussels sprouts and 5–10 mushroom halves.
