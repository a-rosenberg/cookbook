  "title": "mushroom mapo tofu",
  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "3 Japanese Cups medium grain or jasmine rice; cooked in rice cooker",
    "1-2 oz dried shitake mushrooms; soaked in 4 cups water",
    "12 oz crimini mushrooms",
    "2 lb soft tofu; cut into 1\" cubes",
    "2 leeks; halved lengthwise, washed and slived into 1\" pieces on an angle",
    "2 Tbsp ginger; minced",
    "2 Tbsp garlic; minced",
    "2 tsp gochugaru",
    "4 Tbsp doubanjiang",
    "2 tbsp sichuan peppercorn (optional)",
    "3 Tbsp chili crisp; I prefer Momofuku brand",
    "2 Tbsp fermented black bean paste",
    "2 Tbsp corn starch mixed with 2 Tbsp cold water to form a slurry"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Drain the shitake mushrooms (reserving the soaking liquid) and finely chop them along with the fresh mushrooms - discarding any hard stems. Have all the mise en place ready before starting cooking.",
    "Bring a pot of salted water to boil and poach the tofu. Drain, lightly season with salt and keep warm.",
    "Heat 1 Tbsp oil in a large deep pan or a wok over high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, turning over every once in a while so that everything cooks and browns.",
    "Once the mushrooms release their liquid, and it evaporates, add the leek, garlic and ginger and cook for 3 minutes. Scoop the vegetables out of the wok and wipe clean if needed.",
    "Add another 1 Tbsp oil to the pan/wok and put it back on high heat.  Add the doubanjiang, chili crisp, black bean, sichuan pepper (if using), and gochugaru flakes.  Fry, stirring continuously so it doesn't burn, until the oil separates from the mixture - about 1 minute.",
    "Stir the mushroom soaking liquid into the hot mixture, then add the vegetables and bring to a boil. Add the cornstarch slurry and boil again.  Stir in the tofu cubes and stir carefully to coat.",
    "Serve with rice."
  ],
  "notes": "A lot of these ingredients will have to be acquired at the asian grocery store; e.g., H-mart."
