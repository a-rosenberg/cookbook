  "title": "mushroom ramen",
  "ingredients": [
    "8 oz mushrooms; sliced",
    "3–4 stalks kale; destemmed, halved lengthwise, and thinly sliced",
    "3-4 cups broth",
    "2–3 packets ramen noodles; seasoning discarded",
    "1/2 cup coconut milk (optional)",
    "1 tsp soy sauce",
    "1/2 container extra-firm tofu; small dice",
    "chili crisp (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a medium pot or deep skillet, cook the sliced mushrooms over medium heat until they release most of their moisture and begin to brown.",
    "Add the sliced kale and stir to combine, cooking until it just wilts.",
    "Pour in the broth and bring to a gentle boil.",
    "Add the ramen noodles, breaking up the noodle cakes after a few minutes to help them separate, and cook until they’re tender with just a bit of bite (about 7–8 minutes if using brown rice/millet ramen).",
    "Stir in the diced tofu and soy sauce, allowing them to cook together for a few more minutes.",
    "Pour in the coconut milk, heat through but do not boil, and adjust seasoning if needed.",
    "Ladle into bowls, topping each serving with a drizzle of chili crisp if desired."
  ],
  "notes": "Lotus brown rice and millet ramen both work great; Momofuku chili crunch is an excellent topping. For extra flavor, try adding a few slices of fresh ginger to the broth and garnish with thinly sliced green onions. Can also be made without coconut milk - just add extra broth.",
