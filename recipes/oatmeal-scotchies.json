  "ingredients": [
    "1½ Cups (188g) all-purpose flour",
    "1 tsp baking soda",
    "1 tsp ground cinnamon",
    "½ tsp salt",
    "1 Cup (226g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature",
    "1 Cup (200g) packed light or dark brown sugar",
    "½ Cup (100g) granulated sugar",
    "2 large eggs; room temperature",
    "1 Tbsp (15ml) unsulphured or dark molasses (do not use blackstrap)",
    "2 tsp pure vanilla extract",
    "3 Cups (240g) old-fashioned whole rolled oats",
    "1¾ Cups (300g) butterscotch morsels"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Set aside.",
    "In a large bowl using a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the softened butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until creamy and combined, about 2 minutes.",
    "Add the eggs, molasses, and vanilla extract to the butter mixture. Beat on high speed until combined, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.",
    "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low speed until combined.",
    "With the mixer on low speed, beat in the oats and butterscotch morsels until evenly distributed. The dough will be thick and sticky.",
    "Cover the dough tightly with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 45 minutes, or up to 4 days. Chilling is mandatory for this cookie dough.",
    "When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.",
    "Scoop about 3 Tbsp of dough per cookie and roll into balls. Place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 3 inches apart.",
    "Bake the cookies for 12–14 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned. The centers will look soft and undercooked.",
    "Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely."

  "notes": "- **Storage:** Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week. - **Make-Ahead Instructions:** You can make the cookie dough and chill it in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Let it sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes before baking. Baked cookies freeze well for up to 3 months. Unbaked cookie dough balls freeze well for up to 3 months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute; no need to thaw. - **Molasses:** Avoid using blackstrap molasses, as it is too bitter for this recipe. - **Oats:** Use old-fashioned whole rolled oats for the best texture. Quick oats are too fine and will make the cookies dry. - **Butterscotch Morsels:** Ensure they are fresh and not stale for the best flavor and texture.",
