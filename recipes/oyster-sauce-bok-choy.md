### ingredients
- 2 lb of baby or normal bok choy
- 1 tbsp of neutral oil; e.g., avocado oil 
- 1.5 tsp of salt 
- 6-8 cloves of garlic (minced)
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil 
- 3 Tbsp oyster sauce 
- 2 Tbsp of soy sauce; Japanese shoyu, or Chinese light soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp of sugar

### instructions
1. Trim the bottom of the bok choy and halve or quarter depending on size. Bring pot of water to simmer and add salt and oil. Cook 3-4 minutes, in batches if necessary. Want it to be tender but still have crunch.
1. Add in minced garlic, vegetarian oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and sesame oil in a pan. Let it simmer for 1-2 minutes, or until the sugar has melted.
1. Drizzle the sauce over the bok choy and serve. 

### notes
Reminds me of the chinese brocolli in oyster sauce at Woody's Wings and Things.  Maybe combine with mushrooms to make a meal over rice?
