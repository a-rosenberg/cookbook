  "notes": "There are many ways to make pancakes... this is my favorite. Another option is banana pancakes which have good flavor but worse texture: - 3 ripe bananas - 3 eggs - almond flour - 1 scant tsp baking powder - salt (optional) - neutral or coconut oil Smash bananas until they’re pudding. Mix in the eggs. Add flour until good pancake consistency (maybe 1/4 to 1/2 cup). Add baking powder and stir or whisk in. Add a pinch of salt if desired. Cook with oil."
