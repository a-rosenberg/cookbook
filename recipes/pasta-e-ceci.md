### ingredients
- 3 Tbsp olive oil
- 2 stalks celery; roughly chopped
- 1 carrot; roughly chopped
- 1 yellow onion; roughly chopped
- 3 sprigs rosemary; finely minced (optional)
- 8 cups vegetable stock (I prefer better than bouillon)
- 1 15 oz cans chickpeas; drained and rinsed
- 8 oz. small pasta (cavatelli, ditalini or oriechette) 
- kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 Tbsp parsley; minced plus a little more for topping
- parmesan cheese for serving; microplaned or grated
- 1/2 lemon (optional but recommended)

### instructions
1. Heat oil in a large saucepan or pot over medium-high; add rosemary, celery, carrot, and onion and cook until soft, 8-10 minutes. 
1. Add stock and chickpeas; simmer 5 minutes. Remove half the chickpeas and pur√©e until smooth; return chickpeas to pan. 
1. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Taste for acid and add lemon juice if needed.
1. Stir in parsley. Serve with parmesan cheese and extra parsley.

### notes
Doubles well.  If you don't have fresh rosemary, do not add dried.
