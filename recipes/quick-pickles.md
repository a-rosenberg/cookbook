### ingredients
- 1 mason jar packed with vegetables
- 1 cup hot tap water
- 1/2 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
- 5 Tbsp granulated sugar
- 2 1/4 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp corriander seeds (optional)

### instructions
1. Combine sugar, salt, vinegar and water in bowl and stir until dissolved.
2. Pour into mason jar until vegetables are fully covered or brine reaches the top.  Add corriander if using.
3. Place in fridge.  Can be eaten after a day or two.  Will be fully 'ready' after four days.  Will keep for a month.

### notes
This is enough brine for a wide mouth tallboy mason jar.
