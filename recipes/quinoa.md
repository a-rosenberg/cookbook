### ingredients
- 1 scant Tbsp oil; extra virgin olive oil or avocado work 
- 1 cup quinoa
- 1.75 cup vegetable broth; ideally hot.

### instructions
1. Set a saucepan over medium heat. Rinse the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer and drain well.
2. Toast the quinoa. Add the oil to the saucepan and then the quinoa, stirring constantly to let the remaining water evaporate and the quinoa to toast. 2-3 minutes. You should smell the quinoa toasting.
3. Stir in the broth and bring to a boil. Once boiling, cover and reduce to the lowest heat. Leave to cook, undisturbed for 15 minutes.
4. Turn off heat but leave covered for 5 more minutes. Then fluff with a fork and let the residual steam evaporate, uncovered. Should be ready to serve in 5 minutes.

### notes
Can be used in place of a lot of grains. Good in quinoa burritos.
