### ingredients
- 1 Manishewvitz matzoh ball mix packet
- 2 large eggs 
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil or neutral oil 
- 4 stalks celery; diced
- 6 carrots; diced - no need to peel
- 8 cups vegetable broth; preferably from better than bouillon concentrate
- egg soup noodles
- 1 handful parsley; chopped 
- (optional) 1 bulb fresh fennel; cut into small, bite-sized pieces, fronds reserved 


### instructions
1. Mix eggs and oil with a fork in a metal mixing bowl then add matzoh until just combined.  Leave fork in the bowl, cover and put in the fridge for 25 minutes to cool.
1. While thatâ€™s cooling add 8 cups of veggie broth to pot and start heating. Chop vegetables and add them to the broth. Cover and bring to a boil.
1. Start a drizzle of cold water from the tap to wet your hands and begin making golf ball sized smooth balls. As each ball is made drop it in the pot of boiling broth. Once all balls and in the pot, cover again and bring temperature to low - just enough to keep a light simmer in the pot. Do not remove the top for 30 minutes.
1. 10 minutes before the soup is finished, bring a pot of lightly salted water to boil and cook the egg noodles until very al dente.
1. When soup is cooked, turn off heat and mix in parsley. Check seasoning and adjust. Spoon into bowls and add the al dente noodles as desired. Top with fennel fronds if using.

### notes
It's tradition for Dad to say this is too salty no matter how salty it is.
