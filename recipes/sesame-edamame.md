### ingredients
- 250 g whole edamame 
- 1-2 Tbsp black sesame; broken up in mortar and pestle 
- 1 tsp sesame oil 
- pinch or two of kosher salt 
- togarashi (optional)  

### instructions
1. Place the edamame directly on a baking sheet and broil on high, flipping around until browned with a bit of char; maybe 7-15 minutes. 
1. Once cooked, take the edamame out and into a bowl.  Mix in the remaining ingredients, tossing really well so that the sesame seeds and salt stick to the edamame.
1. Serve with an extra bowl for the edamame shells.

### notes
If you can't find togarashi, a little red pepper flake or gochugaru will work.
