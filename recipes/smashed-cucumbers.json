  "instructions": [
    "Trim ends off of cucumber(s) and cut into 4–5\" segments if long. Use the butt of a chef's knife to break the cucumber into pieces. It should result in 3–4 lengthwise sections.  Remove any pulp that was squished out and cut the segments on a bias in 1/4–1/2\" slices.",
    "Toss cucumbers with all other ingredients and let marinate for 10 minutes if possible.  If done ahead of time, keep in the fridge until 20–30 minutes before serving."
