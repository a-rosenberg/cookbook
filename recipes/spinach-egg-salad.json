  "notes": "- Scales at 100%. - Avoid boiling more than 6 eggs at a time due to the temperature dip. - For best peeling, place eggs straight from the fridge into 1\" of boiling water to steam and boil simultaneously. After cooking, transfer eggs directly into a bowl of ice water and let sit for at least 10 minutes."
