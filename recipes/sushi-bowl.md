### ingredients
rice 
- 3 rice cooker cups of white short or medium grain rice 
- 4 Tbsp rice vinegar 
- 3 Tbsp (scant) sugar 
- 1 tsp kosher salt 
- approx 2”x2” kombu (optional)

spicy mayo
- 4 Tbsp kewpie mayonnaise 
- 2 Tbsp sriracha or similar hot sauce

other toppings
- 12-16 oz smoked slab salmon 
- avocado; sliced
- 1 cucumber thinly sliced and tossed with small amount of salt (optionally sugar), or 1 recipe of "smashed cucumbers" - below
- nori slices to make little sushi tacos
- pickled red onion, radish or jalapeño
- white and black toasted sesame seeds 
- Broiled asparagus

smashed cucumbers (optional)
- 2 seedless cucumbers; about 1 to 1 1/2 lbs
- 1 tsp salt
- 2.5 tsp sugar
- 2 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 3 tsp soy sauce
- 1.5 Tbsp rice vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic; finely chopped (optional)
- 1-2 tsp chili oil; I love momofuku chili crunch for this
- 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds

### instructions
1. Start by cooking the rice in a rice cooker on the white or sushi setting. Make rice seasoning while it cooks by combining and stirring the rice vinegar, sugar and salt in a small mason jar. 
1. When the rice finishes cooking lay it out into a non-metallic broad bowl or even a glass tray and distribute the rice seasoning as evenly as possible. Carefully fold to combine. Fan with a sheet pan if possible to help cool the rice faster. 
1. If you're feeling lazy you can mix it into the rice cooker directly and leave it open to cool a bit.
1. Spicy mayo is just mixing together the mayonnaise and sriracha. With kewpie mayo it should be drizzle-able.
1. Break apart salmon and place on top of some rice, then add all the toppings you’d want.

(optional) smashed cucumbers recipe 
1. Trim ends off of cucumber(s) and cut into 4-5" segments if long. Use the butt of a chef's knife to break the cucumber into pieces. It should result in 3-4 lengthwise sections.  Remove any pulp that was squished out and cut the segments on a bias in 1/4-1/2" slices.
1. Toss cucumbers with all other ingredients and let marinate for 10 minutes if possible.  If done ahead of time, keep in the fridge until 20-30 minutes before serving.
