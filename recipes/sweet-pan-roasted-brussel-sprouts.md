### ingredients
- 1 lb brussel sprouts; bottoms trimmed and cut in half 
- 2 Tbsp olive oil; maybe more 
- 2 Tbsp maple syrup
- 1-2 Tbsp balsamic vinegar 
- salt and pepper to taste 

### instructions
1. Heat cast iron pan over medium heat. Add oil then add sprouts with salt and pepper, stirring only occasionally to allow for browning to develop. 
1. Once tender through, add syrup and vinegar and stir almost continuously to prevent burning. Cook until sprouts are well coated and the sauce thickens slightly. Turn off heat but keep in pan for serving to keep them warm. 

### notes
Good the next day too.
