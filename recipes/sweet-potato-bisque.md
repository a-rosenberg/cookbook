### ingredients
- 2 Tbsp coconut oil (or other neutral oil)
- 1 onion or 2 shallots; diced
- 1 thumb ginger; finely chopped
- 2 lb sweet potato; peeled and cubed
- 1 scant tsp salt 
- 1 Tbsp curry powder
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- 3 cups water 
- 1/2 cup coconut milk (or almond milk) plus more for drizzling if desired
- 1/4 bunch of cilantro (optional); washed and chopped 
- 1 lime (optional); cut into wedges


### instructions
1. Cook the onion and ginger in coconut oil in a deep soup pot over medium heat stirring occasionally, until soft -- about 
10 minutes. 
1. Add the salt and spices and stir.  Add the cubed sweet potatoes and toss to coat then add the water.  Bring to a boil 
then reduce to a simmer and cook until fork tender -- about 15 minutes.
1. Transfer to a blender and remove blender plug then cover with a towel (or paper towel that will resist yellowing 
from curry powder).  Blend until smooth.  Either manually increasing slowly from low to high speed remaining on high for 
about 30 seconds or using the puree setting on the Vitamix.
1. Rinse out pot if any small pieces of onion or potato remain and transfer puree back.  Reheat over a low flame 
and stir in coconut milk (or almond milk).  Check the seasoning then serve with cilantro and lime.


### notes
Also goes well with some crunchy toasted bread.
