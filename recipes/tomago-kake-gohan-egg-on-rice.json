  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "1-2 cups cooked short or medium grain white rice",
    "1 egg",
    "1 tsp shoyu",
    "1 tsp mirin",
    "1 pinch salt",
    "1 smaller pinch MSG",
    "(optional) asparagus",
    "(optional) nori",
    "(optional) furikake",
    "(optional) diced kimchi"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Heat white rice until piping hot - 1.5 minutes in our microwave.",
    "Make a small hole in the middle of the rice and crack in egg and top with the rest of the non-optional ingredients.",
    "Whisk in with chopsticks and top with the optional stuff."
  ],
  "notes": "If using leftover sushi rice just add a tiny bit of shoyu and MSG -- the mirin and pinch of salt would make it too sweet and salty. If going for something really decadent, you can add a second egg yolk once mixed. Could probably use a semi-brown haiga rice for this dish as well.",
