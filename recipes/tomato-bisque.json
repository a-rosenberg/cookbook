  "title": "tomato bisque",
  "introduction": "",
  "ingredients": [
    "olive oil",
    "1 (28 oz) can whole tomatoes (Bianco DiNapoli recommended)",
    "1 (15 oz) can full-fat coconut milk",
    "1 onion; diced",
    "3-4 garlic cloves; sliced",
    "salt and pepper",
    "maple syrup",
    "1 red bell pepper; cut into chunks (optional)"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Heat a few glugs of olive oil in a pot over medium heat.",
    "Add onion and cook until browning and caramelizing, about 10 minutes. Optionally, add red bell pepper. A little salt may help the onions break down.",
    "Add garlic and cook for 2–3 minutes.",
    "Add tomatoes and break them into smaller pieces using a meat masher or potato masher. Simmer for a few minutes.",
    "Add coconut milk and a few cracks of pepper. Bring to a simmer for 5–10 minutes.",
    "Use a stick blender to blend to desired consistency.",
    "Simmer for another 5–15 minutes, keeping the temperature low to prevent burning.",
    "Taste for seasoning and adjust with salt and maple syrup as needed (about 1 tsp of maple syrup recommended)."
  ],
  "notes": "- Should be served with grilled cheese. A better option is grilled cheese with kimchi or sauerkraut. - Simmering longer will develop a deeper flavor. - Cooking times are approximate; keep the temperature low to prevent burning. - Can be doubled at 100%."
