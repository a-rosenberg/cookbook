### ingredients
- 1 onion; small dice
- 4-6 garlic cloves; minced
- 1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
- 28 oz can tomato sauce
- 28 oz can crushed, diced or whole tomatoes
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp thyme or basil or both
- 10-12 oz frozen spinach 
- 16-24 oz frozen tortellini
- 2 14 oz can of canellini beans; drained and rinsed
- parmesan for ganish (optional)

### instructions
1. Cook onion and garlic until starting to become transluscent; about 5 minutes.  About halfway through the cook add red pepper 
flakes if using. 
2. Add tomato sauce, other can of tomatoes (broken smaller in your hand or pot if using whole tomaters), and 28 oz of 
water (another can full) to pot.  Add dired herbs and bring to a simmer for 10 minutes.  Skim any weird tomato foam that might 
float to the top. 
3. Add rinsed beans and stir.  Then add frozen spinach and stir to break up any clumps.  Cook until pot returns to a boil and the 
spinach is thoroughly broken apart. 
4. Add the frozen spinach and cook; anywhere from 3-10 minutes when the tortellini are tender.
5. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
6. Serve with optional parmesan garnish.
