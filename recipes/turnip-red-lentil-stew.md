### ingredients
- 1 sweet onion; diced
- 4 garlic cloves; minced
- 1 bunch of small turnips (I like hakurei); washed, trimmed, and quartered or 2 large turnips; peeled and 1/2" dice
- 1 can tomato puree
- 4 cups vegetable broth and extra vegetable base concentrate
- 1/2 bunch chard (could substitute lacinato kale); washed, thick stems removed, and thinly sliced
- 1 cup red lentils; rinsed
- 2 tbsp olive or neutral oil
- 1/2 tsp thyme (fresh or dried)
- 1/4 tsp dried sage (optional)
- pinch of red pepper flakes (optional)

optional
- 2 shallots; cut in half lengthwise and thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup neutral oil
- 1 pinch salt


### instructions
1. Heat pan on medium then add oil and onion. Cook until onion begins to soften then add garlic and cook until both are softened through - just sweating the veggies, no need to try to brown here. Add turnips and toss with aromatics.  Add tomato sauce and veggie broth and stir to combine. If using conventional, large turnips, cook for 15 minutes to get out any bitterness.  Add lentils and stir again. 
2. If making the optional crispy, caramelized shallots, add shallots and oil to a pan on medium low.  After a few minutes the shallots should be sizzling as they release their moisture.  Cook while stirring occasionally and continue with the stew steps below. About 20 minutes in the shallots should be turning golden. Remove them from the oil and spread out on a paper towel lined plate and sprinkle with salt.  
3. Bring soup to a boil then reduce to a simmer and cook for about 20 minutes stirring occasionally. Around then the lentils will be a consistent color and texture though and will plump up to fill the pot all of the sudden. At this point stir in the herbs if you're using them and the greens and let cook for a couple minutes.  
4. Taste the soup- if it lacks body, add vegetable broth base 1/2 tsp at a time, or maybe a pinch of salt if it just needs more seasoning.

### notes
Serve with a crack of pepper and/or a pinch of red pepper flakes.
