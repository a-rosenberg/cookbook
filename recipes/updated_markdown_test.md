### Instructions

1. **Cook Lentils**  
   Rinse red lentils until the water runs clear. Place in a tall pot and cover with 2.5 cups of cold water.  
   Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 10–15 minutes.

2. **Prepare Spices and Base**  
   While the lentils cook, heat oil in a pan over medium-low heat. When hot, add peppercorns and cloves, cooking until fragrant (about 30 seconds).  
   Add onions and cook, stirring often, for 8–10 minutes until golden. Add ginger and crush garlic into the pan (using a press, if available).  
   Cook for 2–3 minutes until fragrant but not burnt. Add spices and salt, stirring to coat.

3. **Add Tomatoes**  
   Add the canned tomatoes, crushing them with your hands or a wooden spoon.  
   Bring to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes. Cover and simmer for another 5 minutes until thickened.

4. **Combine with Lentils**  
   Once the sauce has darkened, add lentils gradually with a slotted spoon. If too thick, thin with reserved lentil cooking liquid (usually not needed).  
   Simmer on low heat for 10 minutes. Leave uncovered if you prefer a thicker consistency. Adjust seasoning to taste.  
   Add cayenne for spice or lemon juice for acidity, if desired.

5. **Serve**  
   Serve with basmati rice or naan, garnished with chopped cilantro.
